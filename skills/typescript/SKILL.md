User preferences and memory live in `~/Clawic/data/typescript/` (see `setup.md` on first use, `memory-template.md` for the file format). If you have data at an old location (`~/typescript/` or `~/clawic/typescript/`), move it to `~/Clawic/data/typescript/`, and say in one line that you moved it and from where.

## When To Use

- Decoding type errors: "not assignable" walls, narrowing failures, inference surprises, errors that appear only in CI
- Designing types for an API surface: generics, discriminated unions, utility types, branded types
- tsconfig decisions: strict flags, module resolution, target/lib, monorepo project references, JS-to-TS migration order
- Writing or fixing declaration files (`.d.ts`, module augmentation, publishing types)
- Code that compiles green but fails at runtime — ESM/CJS interop crashes, unvalidated external data — or tsc/editor slowness
- Not for runtime JavaScript semantics (closures, event loop, coercion) — that is the javascript skill

## Quick Reference

| Situation | Play |
|---|---|
| Value of unknown shape (API, `JSON.parse`, `catch`) | `unknown` + narrow before use; never `any` |
| Config/lookup object losing literal types | `satisfies` (TS >=4.9), not a type annotation |
| Union variant not narrowing | Add a literal discriminant field + exhaustive `never` check |
| 40-line "not assignable" error | Read the deepest `Types of property ... are incompatible` line first — root cause is at the bottom; full decoder → `errors.md` |
| Cryptic diagnostic (TS2589, TS2742, "no overload matches"), error only in CI | `errors.md` |
| Generic won't infer / variance confusion / overload design | `generics.md` |
| `Partial`/`Omit`/`Record` behaving oddly | `utility-types.md` |
| Untyped npm package, globals, augmentation, publishing types | `declarations.md` |
| JS conversion, strict-flag rollout, `as` debt, TS version upgrade | `migration.md` |
| target/module/paths choices, monorepo, project references | `tsconfig.md` |
| Green compile, runtime crash (`x is not a function`, `ERR_REQUIRE_ESM`) | `modules.md` |
| External data crossing a trust boundary | Validate at runtime at the boundary; static types only downstream → `boundaries.md` |
| tsc slow, editor lag, compiler out of memory | `performance.md` |
| Anything else typed | Default: full `strict`, infer locals, annotate exports |

Depth on demand: `errors.md` diagnostic decoding · `generics.md` inference, variance, conditional types, overloads · `utility-types.md` built-in type traps · `declarations.md` .d.ts, augmentation, publishing · `migration.md` JS-to-TS, strictness ratchets, TS upgrades · `tsconfig.md` compiler configuration · `modules.md` ESM/CJS interop · `boundaries.md` runtime validation · `performance.md` compile and editor speed.

## Core Rules

1. **Full `strict` or you are reviewing half the code.** Every flag off is a bug class the checker won't report. Greenfield: `strict: true` day one plus `noUncheckedIndexedAccess` (TS >=4.1). Legacy: stage flags with a ratchet (`migration.md`).
2. **`unknown` in, typed out.** Data you didn't construct (network, JSON, env, storage) enters as `unknown` and gets validated once at the boundary (`boundaries.md`); past that point no `any` and no re-checking.
3. **Annotate exports, infer locals.** Annotated parameters and return on every exported function put errors at the boundary that caused them, not at 30 call sites downstream; inference inside bodies keeps the noise down.
4. **Make illegal states unrepresentable.** n independent optional fields admit 2^n combinations: `{ data?: T; error?: E }` is 4 states of which 2 are illegal. A discriminated union with one variant per legal state encodes exactly the truth.
5. **Every `as` carries a proof.** A cast overrides the checker — attach the runtime guard that makes it true, or a one-line comment saying why it cannot be wrong. An unexplained cast is a deferred bug report.
6. **Exhaustive by construction.** Every `switch` over a union ends in `default: x satisfies never` (TS >=4.9) — adding a variant then becomes a compile error at every site that must handle it, which is the entire point of the union.
7. **Errors read bottom-up.** The first lines of a long diagnostic are wrappers; the root cause is the deepest `Types of property ... are incompatible` line (`errors.md`).

## Stop Using `any`

- `any` is viral both directions: it silences errors on reads AND poisons everything it's assigned to. `unknown` only blocks reads until you narrow — same flexibility, none of the spread
- `catch (e)` is `unknown` under strict since TS 4.4 (`useUnknownInCatchVariables`) — check `e instanceof Error` before `.message`
- Every remaining cast (`as`) gets either a runtime guard above it or a one-line comment saying why it's safe (rule 5)
- Ratchet, don't boil the ocean: count `any`s (typescript-eslint `no-explicit-any` + `no-unsafe-*`), record the baseline, fail CI when the count rises

## Inference & Widening

Widening:

- `let x = "hello"` is `string`; `const x = "hello"` is `"hello"` — mutability drives widening
- Object and array literals widen their members even under `const`: `const cfg = { mode: "dark" }` has `mode: string` — `as const` freezes the whole tree (readonly + literals)
- Literal arguments: primitives infer as literals, objects/arrays widen — `<const T>` type parameters (TS >=5.0) preserve them at the call site
- Function return types widen too — annotate the return when a caller needs the literal

Inference limits:

- Inference flows from arguments to parameters, not through intermediate generics — when a nested generic fails, name the intermediate type and split into two steps
- No partial type argument inference: `fn<T, U>` with one explicit argument turns off inference for the rest — use the curried two-call pattern `make<T>()(config)` to fix one and infer the other
- `NoInfer<T>` (TS >=5.4) excludes a position from inference: `declare function set<T>(vals: T[], initial: NoInfer<T>): void` — without it, a wrong `initial` widens `T` instead of erroring
- Callback parameters get contextual types only when the expected signature is known — assigning the function to a typed variable or parameter is what enables `(x) =>` without annotation

## Discriminated Unions & Narrowing

Modeling with unions:

- Add a literal `kind` field to each variant — narrowing and exhaustive switches come free (rules 4 and 6)
- Discriminant must be a literal type — a field typed `string` discriminates nothing; `as const` the source values

Narrowing failures:

- `filter(Boolean)` doesn't narrow in any TS version — write `.filter((x): x is T => Boolean(x))`. TS >=5.5 infers predicates from simple lambdas, so `.filter(x => x != null)` narrows there; below 5.5 it doesn't
- Narrowing dies inside callbacks: after `if (x)`, `arr.map(() => x.foo)` re-errors because TS assumes `x` may be reassigned — copy to a `const` before the callback
- `typeof x === "object"` includes `null` — check `x !== null` in the same condition
- `Object.keys(obj)` returns `string[]`, not `keyof typeof obj` — intentional: structural types can carry extra keys. Cast only when you own the object literal
- `Array.isArray()` on `unknown` narrows to `any[]` — element type needs its own check
- `in` narrows unions only when the property appears in exactly one branch; on unlisted properties it narrows since TS 4.9
- Destructured discriminants (`const { kind } = action; if (kind === ...)`) narrow only in TS >=4.6 — on older versions switch on `action.kind` directly

## `satisfies` vs Annotation vs Cast

Three tools, three guarantees — pick by what you need to keep:

- `const x: T = v` — checks AND widens to `T`: literal info gone, excess properties rejected
- `const x = v satisfies T` (TS >=4.9) — checks compatibility, keeps the inferred narrow type: the default for config/route/theme objects
- `v as T` — checks nothing beyond rough overlap; `"hello" as number` fails but `{} as User` compiles. It's an assertion, not a conversion

## Strict Null Handling

- `??` vs `||`: `port || 3000` turns a legitimate `0` into 3000; `port ?? 3000` only replaces `null`/`undefined`. Same for `""` in string options
- Optional chaining `?.` produces `undefined`, never `null` — APIs contracted to `null` need an explicit `?? null`
- Non-null `!` is a cast in disguise — prefer early return or narrowing; each `!` is a runtime crash candidate the compiler can no longer see

## Strictness Beyond `strict`

`strict: true` is not the strictest configuration. Flags it does NOT include:

- `noUncheckedIndexedAccess` (TS >=4.1) — `arr[i]` and `record[key]` become `T | undefined`. Catches the most common real crash (indexing off the end); enable on greenfield day one, on legacy expect a large error wave and stage it
- `exactOptionalPropertyTypes` (TS >=4.4) — distinguishes "absent" from "explicitly undefined"; breaks code that assigns `undefined` to optional props
- `noPropertyAccessFromIndexSignature`, `noImplicitOverride` — cheap to adopt, low churn
- `verbatimModuleSyntax` (TS >=5.0) — forces `import type` for type-only imports; the modern replacement for `isolatedModules` import hygiene (`modules.md`)

Everything else about compiler configuration — target/lib, `module` × `moduleResolution`, paths, monorepos — lives in `tsconfig.md`; import/export mechanics and transpile-only compatibility in `modules.md`.

## Where To Annotate

- Default: annotate exported function signatures (parameters AND return), infer everything inside bodies (rule 3)
- Explicit return types on the public surface also unlock `isolatedDeclarations` (TS >=5.5) and faster declaration emit
- A type parameter must relate at least two positions (two params, or param and return). Used once, it's decoration — replace with `unknown` or the concrete type
- Slow type checking has structural causes and a measurement workflow — `performance.md`

## Output Gates

Before emitting TypeScript, verify:

- No `any` introduced, explicit or implicit — `unknown` where the shape is genuinely open?
- Exported functions annotated, parameters and return?
- Every `as` has a runtime guard above it or a justifying comment?
- Every `switch` over a union ends in an exhaustiveness check?
- External data validated at runtime before its first typed use?
- No `!` where narrowing or `??` would prove it?

## Configuration

User-dependent variables. Defaults apply until the user states a preference; store them in `~/Clawic/data/typescript/config.yaml`.

| Variable | Type | Default | Effect |
|---|---|---|---|
| runtime_target | node \| browser \| bun \| deno \| isomorphic | node | Drives `module`/`moduleResolution` and lib advice in `tsconfig.md` and import-extension rules in `modules.md` |
| project_kind | app \| library | app | Library flips guidance to declaration emit, exports-map types, and wider TS-version support; app defaults to `skipLibCheck` and bundler resolution |
| compile_pipeline | tsc \| transpile-only | transpile-only | transpile-only (esbuild, swc, Babel, bundlers) enforces the single-file-safe subset: no `const enum`, `isolatedModules` rules apply (`modules.md`); tsc lifts those bans |
| validation_library | zod \| valibot \| arktype \| ajv \| none | none | Names the schema library used in boundary-validation examples (`boundaries.md`); none keeps guidance library-neutral |
| ts_version | text (e.g. "5.4") | latest | Gates every `TS >=X.Y`-marked recommendation in this skill: below the mark, the pre-version workaround is offered instead (e.g. below 4.9 an annotation replaces `satisfies`) |

Preference areas to record as the user reveals them:

- **conventions** — `interface` vs `type` default, type naming style, banned features (enums, namespaces, decorators), type-only import style
- **strictness posture** — which beyond-`strict` flags to push proactively, cast tolerance, error-suppression policy
- **tooling** — package manager, typescript-eslint strictness, monorepo layout (project references vs single config), type-test tooling
- **output format** — quick fix vs explained fix, whether to show before/after diffs

## Traps

| Trap | Why it fails | Do instead |
|---|---|---|
| `enum` | The one TS feature with runtime emit; `const enum` breaks under transpile-only compilers | `as const` object + `keyof typeof` (`modules.md`) |
| `Function` or `{}` as a type | `Function` accepts any callable and calls return `any`; `{}` accepts everything except `null`/`undefined` | Exact signature `(a: A) => R`; `Record<string, unknown>` for bags |
| Trusting excess property checks as validation | They fire only on fresh object literals — a value passed through a variable skips them | Runtime validation at boundaries (`boundaries.md`) |
| `// @ts-ignore` | Keeps suppressing after the error is fixed, hiding the next one | `// @ts-expect-error` (TS >=3.9) — errors itself once stale |
| `!` to silence `strictNullChecks` | Each one is an invisible cast and a crash candidate | Narrow, early-return, or `??`; sanctioned only for framework-assigned class fields (`migration.md`) |
| `[key: string]: any` to quiet index errors | Poisons every access on the object with `any` | Precise keys, `Record<K, V>`, or a `Map`; `noUncheckedIndexedAccess` (TS >=4.1) keeps even honest signatures honest |

## Where Experts Disagree

- **`interface` vs `type`.** Default: `interface` for object shapes (merges for augmentation, caches relationships for faster checking), `type` for unions, functions, tuples, and mapped/conditional results. An existing codebase convention beats either.
- **Explicit return types everywhere vs boundary-only.** Boundary-only is the default (rule 3). The everywhere school wins on published libraries and under `isolatedDeclarations` (TS >=5.5), where emit requires them anyway.
- **Runtime validation depth.** Edges-only is the default — validating internally recomputes what the checker already proved. The schema-first school (schema as source of truth, static types inferred from it) wins when one shape crosses many boundaries (`boundaries.md`).
