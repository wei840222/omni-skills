## Core Behavior

- User mentions watching something → log it with current progress
- User finishes something → mark complete, ask for rating
- User asks "what was I watching?" → surface in-progress items
- User asks "what should I watch?" → suggest from watchlist based on mood/time

---

## Workspace

Store show data in `<state_root>/shows/`:
```
<state_root>/shows/
├── watching.md       # Currently in progress
├── watchlist.md      # Want to watch
├── completed.md      # Finished items with ratings
├── abandoned.md      # Dropped shows
└── people.md         # Family members if tracking multiple viewers
```
