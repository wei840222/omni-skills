All persistent data (site profiles, config, audit history, keyword tracking) lives in `~/Clawic/data/seo/`. If you have data at an old location (`~/seo/` or `~/clawic/seo/`), move it to `~/Clawic/data/seo/`, and say in one line that you moved it and from where. Read `setup.md` on first use; `memory-template.md` holds the file format.

## When To Use

- Auditing a site: indexing, technical health, on-page, content, links, structure
- Diagnosing a ranking or organic traffic drop, a deindexed page, or a core-update hit
- Writing, refreshing, or consolidating content to rank for a target query
- Keyword research, opportunity sizing, competitor gap analysis, cannibalization
- Shipping structural changes safely: migrations, redesigns, hreflang, faceted navigation, programmatic pages
- Earning visibility in the surfaces above the ten blue links: snippets, packs, AI Overviews
- Not for paid search ads (PPC, Google Ads bidding, quality score) or for content planning with no search target — route to `content-marketing`

## Core Rules

1. **Audit before prescribing.** Fixed order: manual actions → indexing → intent match → technical → content → links. Diagnosing content quality on a page Google never indexed wastes the engagement; every layer above depends on the one before it.
2. **The SERP is the spec.** Before writing or prescribing format, search the exact query in the target market. Page 1 defines format, depth, and freshness. If page 1 is all product grids, a 3,000-word guide will not rank there at any quality level.
3. **Improve before you create.** Pages at position 4-15 in Search Console with impressions at or above `min_impressions` (Configuration; default 100/month) are the highest-ROI work: better snippet, filled content gaps, internal links. Write a new page only when no existing URL targets the intent. Example: a page at position 8 with 1,000 monthly impressions needs a title rewrite and two internal links — not a competing new article, which triggers rule 4.
4. **One intent per page.** Two URLs alternating in Search Console for the same query = cannibalization: Google splits signals and both underperform. Fix: 301 the weaker into the stronger, merge unique content. Map keywords by intent, not by string — Google clusters variants onto one page.
5. **Technical floor.** Core Web Vitals "good" thresholds (Google, field data at p75): LCP < 2.5s, INP < 200ms, CLS < 0.1. HTTPS, mobile-first, self-referencing canonicals, clean sitemap. Technical debt caps everything content can earn.
6. **E-E-A-T is signals, not a score.** No E-E-A-T meter exists — demonstrate it: author bios with verifiable credentials, first-hand evidence (photos, data, tests), citations, contact and about pages. Decisive for YMYL topics (health, finance, legal, safety).
7. **Links: earn, never buy.** Bought links risk manual actions that take months to recover from after cleanup. Internal links are the lever you fully control — spend them before any outreach.
8. **Iterate from Search Console, not assumptions.** Each symptom has a different fix: CTR far below the position curve → rewrite the snippet. Impressions but no clicks → intent or SERP-feature problem. No impressions → indexing or relevance problem. GSC tells you which; guessing does not.
9. **Size the prize before doing the work.** `expected monthly clicks = volume × CTR at the realistic position × (1 − feature discount)`. Worked: 2,000 searches/mo, realistic landing spot position 5 (~5-10% CTR), an AI Overview and an ads block above → 2,000 × 0.07 × 0.6 ≈ 84 clicks/mo. If that number does not justify the build, say so before writing.

## Ranking Drop Triage

In order — stop at the first confirmed cause:

1. GSC → Manual Actions + Security Issues. If flagged, that IS the diagnosis (`recovery.md`).
2. URL Inspection on hit pages: still indexed? Google-selected canonical changed to another URL?
3. Recent deploys: robots.txt edits, stray noindex, redirect changes, template changes shipped near the drop date.
4. Drop date vs Google's announced update dates. Aligned = sitewide quality reassessment, not a page bug — fix the weakest content across the site.
5. Search the lost queries: did the SERP change format or gain features (AI Overview, more ads, a pack) that push you down visually at the same rank?
6. Backlinks: links lost on your side, or a competitor gained them.
7. Seasonality and tracking: compare year-over-year, and confirm the drop is not analytics (broken tag, bot filter, property change) before treating it as SEO.
8. None conclusive → gap-compare the pages that replaced you (`keywords.md`).

## SEO Audit Checklist

**Indexing:**
- [ ] Important pages indexed — verify with URL Inspection and the Page indexing report, not the `site:` operator
- [ ] No important pages blocked in robots.txt
- [ ] XML sitemap submitted to Search Console, only canonical 200-status URLs in it
- [ ] No stray noindex on pages that should rank
- [ ] No page both robots.txt-blocked AND noindexed — blocked crawl means Google never sees the noindex, so the page can stay indexed

**Technical:**
- [ ] Core Web Vitals passing (thresholds in rule 5)
- [ ] Mobile-friendly, HTTPS with no mixed content
- [ ] No crawl errors, no soft 404s, no server errors in Search Console
- [ ] Redirect chains ≤3 hops
- [ ] Rendered HTML contains the main content (JavaScript sites)

**On-Page:**
- [ ] Unique title tags (50-60 chars), meta descriptions (150-160 chars)
- [ ] One H1 per page with the target term; proper heading hierarchy
- [ ] Images with alt text; internal links to and from the page

**Content:**
- [ ] Search intent matched (rule 2)
- [ ] No cannibalization (rule 4)
- [ ] No thin or duplicate content; dead pages improved, consolidated, or removed

**Off-Page and Entity:**
- [ ] Google Business Profile complete (local businesses)
- [ ] Backlink profile checked for toxic patterns
- [ ] Brand queries return the right result, sitelinks, and knowledge panel where applicable

## Content Writing Process

1. **Keyword research** — target keyword, volume, SERP reality check (`keywords.md`)
2. **Intent analysis** — search the query in the target market; page 1 is the format spec
3. **Gap + gain** — cover what ranking pages cover, then add what none of them have
4. **Write** — answer the query in the first ~100 words, then structure per `content.md`
5. **Optimize** — title, meta, headers, internal links from strong pages, schema
6. **Publish** — request indexing once, log in `~/Clawic/data/seo/memory.md`, review GSC after a few weeks

## What Takes How Long

Honest ranges beat invented dates; every one of these is mechanism, not promise.

| Change | Time to effect | Mechanism |
|---|---|---|
| Title or meta rewrite | Days to appear, 2-4 weeks to judge | Needs a recrawl, then enough impressions for CTR to be readable |
| New page, established site | Indexed in days; competitive movement 3-6 months | Discovery is fast; earning position takes links and engagement history |
| New domain | Months before competitive queries move | No confirmed sandbox — the delay is missing links, history, and coverage |
| Core Web Vitals fix | ~4 weeks before field data reflects it | CrUX field data is a 28-day rolling window; lab scores change instantly |
| 301 migration | 2-8 weeks of turbulence, longer on large sites | Google must recrawl every redirected URL to transfer signals |
| Manual action revoked | Days to weeks after reconsideration | Human review queue; recovery of position is separate and slower |
| Core update recovery | Usually at the next update, not between them | Sitewide reassessments are recomputed on update cycles |
| Disavow file | Weeks to months | Applied as links are recrawled, not on upload |

## Output Gates

Before delivering recommendations or content:

- Did I search the actual query in the target market, or am I prescribing format from memory?
- Did I check for an existing page targeting this intent before recommending a new one?
- Is every number I cite from this skill's files or the user's own data, not improvised?
- Does each recommendation name the exact URL and the exact change ("rewrite /pricing title to lead with X"), not "improve content"?
- Did I size the prize (rule 9) so the user can refuse the work?
- Am I promising a date? State the mechanism and a range from What Takes How Long, never a deadline.

## Configuration

User-dependent variables. Defaults apply until the user states a preference; store them in `~/Clawic/data/seo/config.yaml`.

| Variable | Type | Default | Effect |
|---|---|---|---|
| site_type | blog \| ecommerce \| saas \| local \| news \| directory \| auto | auto | Weights the audit checklist and decides which guide the router opens first; `auto` infers from URL patterns and page templates on first look |
| target_market | text (locale, e.g. en-US) | en-US | Which SERP to check, which spelling variant to write, and whether hreflang and local guidance apply |
| tool_access | gsc-only \| paid-suite | gsc-only | `gsc-only` keeps every workflow on free data (GSC, Trends, SERPs); `paid-suite` unlocks backlink-index and difficulty-score steps |
| risk_posture | conservative \| standard \| aggressive | conservative | Gates link tactics, external anchor ratios, and how much templated page generation to recommend |
| cms | wordpress \| shopify \| webflow \| wix \| headless \| other \| auto | auto | Picks the implementation path for every fix (where redirects, robots, and metadata actually live) |
| min_impressions | number (impressions/month) | 100 | Floor for every opportunity list: striking distance (rule 3, `keywords.md`, `search-console.md`) and the traffic-at-stake cutoff for the audit Top 5. Below it, a page cannot produce a readable CTR or click change — raise it on large sites |
| voice_file | path | none | Brand voice guide at `~/Clawic/data/seo/<file>`; governs drafted copy, never the SEO structure |

Preference areas — customizable dimensions; a stated preference gets recorded in config.yaml and applied:

- **Reporting**: audit depth (one-page priorities vs full report), technical vs business language, which KPI leads (clicks, conversions, revenue)
- **Conventions**: URL and slug style, title formula (brand position and separator), heading patterns, internal anchor style
- **Scope boundaries**: sections that are off-limits (legal, careers, docs), staging hosts, URLs never to touch
- **Implementation**: whether the agent edits files and writes patches or hands over specs and tickets
- **Measurement**: reporting property, comparison window, whether branded queries are excluded from "SEO traffic"
- **Thresholds**: floors that gate what gets worked on — impressions (`min_impressions`), traffic at stake for a finding to make the Top 5, minimum sample before a test is called
- **Cadence**: rank and GSC review frequency, content refresh schedule, reporting date

## Traps

| Trap | Why it fails | Do instead |
|------|-------------|------------|
| Writing before checking the SERP | Format mismatch = no ranking at any quality | Rule 2: the SERP is the spec |
| New article for a query an existing page ranks 4-15 for | Cannibalization splits signals | Improve the existing page (rule 3) |
| Chasing keyword density | No density threshold exists; stuffing detection is pattern-based | Cover the topic, use variants naturally |
| noindex on a robots.txt-blocked page | Google never crawls it, never sees the noindex | Allow crawl until deindexed, then block |
| Changing URLs without 301s | Links and authority now point at 404s | Map every old URL to its closest new match |
| Buying links or PBNs | Payment and network footprints → manual action | Earn links via assets and digital PR |
| Reporting rank without checking the rendered SERP | #1 under an AI Overview and four ads earns a fraction of historical #1 clicks | Check pixel position, not just rank |
| Judging index coverage with `site:domain.com` | The operator is an estimate and excludes results Google chooses to hide | Page indexing report + URL Inspection |
| Re-requesting indexing for the same URL repeatedly | The queue is not a priority auction; nothing accelerates | Fix the reason it was not indexed (quality, duplicate, discovery) |
| Fixing every warning a crawler emits | Crawl tools flag non-signals (meta keywords, long titles on pages with no impressions) | Rank issues by the traffic at stake, then fix |
| Optimizing a page whose Google-selected canonical is another URL | Every signal you add credits the other URL | Resolve the canonical conflict first |
| Reporting "average position improved" as a win | Average position moves when the query mix changes; new long-tail impressions drag it down while traffic grows | Report clicks and conversions, positions per query |

## Where Experts Disagree

- **Word count.** Studies show correlation between length and ranking; nobody serious claims causation. Cover the intent fully, then stop — padding is a negative.
- **Disavow.** Google says it is unnecessary without a manual action; some practitioners still disavow after obvious spam attacks. Default: don't, unless a manual action names links.
- **Exact-match anchors.** They move rankings in tests AND they are the first pattern link-spam systems check. The disagreement is the safe ratio, not the risk — keep exact match a small minority of external anchors.
- **Subdomain vs subfolder.** Google states both can rank; migration case studies keep showing subfolder gains. Unresolved: whether the gains come from the structure or from the consolidation and relaunch links that accompany the move. Default subfolder for new builds; do not migrate a working subdomain for this reason alone.
- **Optimizing for AI Overviews.** One camp treats citation as the new goal; the other says citations that suppress clicks are a bad trade and defends click-worthy queries instead. Both are right per query type — decide per page with the click data, not sitewide.
