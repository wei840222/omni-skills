# Group Review — More Than Two Parties

A group is justified only when multiple parties own DIFFERENT consequences (security, ops, product each pay for a different failure). If everyone would lose the same way, that is one lens wearing several faces — run a single-counterpart exchange instead (SKILL.md Counterpart Selection).

## Setup Before Anyone Speaks

- **One named decision owner**, declared before the review starts. Reviews advise; the owner decides. No owner declared = design by committee, and the loudest lens wins by default.
- **Reviewers invited by lens coverage, not seniority.** Each reviewer maps to a distinct loss function (`counterparts.md` catalog); two reviewers with the same lens forward their comments through one of them. Extra same-lens reviewers add signatures, not information.
- **The artifact is a written document** with the position, constraints, and the falsifiable questions per lens (`briefing.md`). No document = the review will re-derive context live and spend its budget on alignment, not critique.

## Written-First Protocol

1. Reviewers comment on the document asynchronously, before any live session. Written comments are independent; live first-reactions anchor on whoever speaks first (same failure as SKILL.md Rule 5, at group scale).
2. Every reviewer labels their own comments: **blocking** (decision must not proceed until resolved) / **non-blocking** (should fix, does not gate) / **preference** (author may ignore). The author must respect someone else's label and resolve or contest it.
3. The author resolves in writing what can be resolved in writing.
4. Live session, if needed at all, covers ONLY the contested blocking threads — with the exchange budget (SKILL.md Rule 3) applied per thread, not per meeting.
5. The owner decides; the record (`convergence.md`) lists each unresolved blocking objection as a surviving objection with its trigger.

## Sign-Off Rules

- Silence is not approval. Each declared lens signs off explicitly or their named concern goes in the record as unassessed risk.
- A blocking label requires a falsifiable reason ("this violates X, observable as Y"). "I'm not comfortable" is a preference wearing a blocking costume — the owner may contest it back to preference.
- Fundamental objections have a deadline: end of the written round. The drive-by reviewer who appears at decision time with "why does this exist at all" reopens nothing unless they bring evidence the written round lacked — otherwise their objection is recorded for the next revisit, not this decision.

## Traps

| Trap | Why it fails | Do instead |
|---|---|---|
| Review as approval ritual | Reviewers sense the decision is made; they perform diligence | If the decision is made, say so and ask only for risk spotting |
| Live-first review | First speaker anchors the room; independent signal destroyed | Written comments before any meeting |
| Owner-less review | Converges on the average of all lenses — incoherent by Rule 7 | Name the owner before inviting anyone |
| Resolving preference comments | Author burns budget polishing to taste while blocking threads wait | Triage order: blocking → non-blocking → done |
| Headcount as rigor | Ten same-lens reviewers = one opinion, ten signatures | Invite by distinct loss function only |
| Endless comment threads | A thread past a few exchanges is a two-party deadlock in public | Move the two parties to a bounded exchange (`deadlock.md`), report the result back |
