# Preferences Template — Brief

Create `<state_root>/preferences.md` with the structure below when the first feedback signal arrives. Learned format preferences only, updated from explicit feedback; one preference per line, each tagged with a level. Declared preferences do not belong here — they go to `config.yaml` (see `setup.md`).

**Rules:**
- Record only explicit signals ("too long", "where are the numbers?") — require active confirmation for inferences.
- 2+ consistent signals → mark `pattern`
- Explicit user approval → `confirmed`; ensure you receive explicit user approval before promoting to confirmed.
- `locked` only after a confirmed preference is reinforced across multiple briefs
- One contradicting signal demotes a `pattern`; a contradicted `confirmed` → ask, ask the user to clarify contradictions before changing a confirmed preference.
- Signal-to-dimension mapping and full level rules: `dimensions.md`
