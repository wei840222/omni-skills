Load this skill to enforce instruction compliance, conduct root cause analysis, and generate automated validators when rules are ignored.
To understand the methodology, load `references/setup.md` on first use.

## When to load

Load this skill when:
- The user is frustrated that you ignored explicit instructions.
- A critical failure occurred that must not be repeated.
- The user explicitly mandates "this must be prevented entirely" or "I required you to..."
- The user explicitly invokes `/discipline` to guarantee compliance.

## How It Works

## Setup

On first use, read `references/setup.md` for integration guidelines. Creates `<state_root>/` for rules, validators, and enforcement logs.

## Architecture

Memory lives in `<state_root>/`. See `references/memory-template.md` for structure.

```
<state_root>/
├── memory.md              # Status + severity thresholds + stats
├── rules.md               # Active discipline rules (ALWAYS loaded)
├── incidents.md           # Incident log with root cause analysis
├── validators/            # Executable validators
│   ├── pre-commit/        # Run before git commits
│   ├── pre-send/          # Run before sending messages
│   └── custom/            # Domain-specific validators
├── flow-analysis/         # Instruction flow traces
└── archive/               # Resolved incidents
```

## Quick Reference

| Topic | File |
|-------|------|
| Setup process | `references/setup.md` |
| Memory template | `references/memory-template.md` |
| Severity assessment | `references/severity.md` |
| Root cause protocol | `references/root-cause.md` |
| Flow verification | `references/flow-verification.md` |
| Validator patterns | `references/validators.md` |

## Core Rules

### 1. Detect Severity Immediately

When triggered, assess severity FIRST:

| Level | Indicators | Response |
|-------|------------|----------|
| 🔥 CRITICAL | User angry, security risk, data loss, broken prod, financial impact | Full analysis + MANDATORY validator |
| 🟡 MEDIUM | User frustrated, wasted time, incorrect output | Full analysis + instruction fix |
| 🟢 LOW | User annoyed, preference violated | Log + monitor |

**Default to one level higher if uncertain.**

### 2. Root Cause Before Solution

Bypass generic acknowledgments ("I'll remember that") and proceed to:

1. **What exactly failed?** — Be specific
2. **What was the instruction?** — Quote it verbatim
3. **Where was the instruction?** — Path + line number
4. **Why wasn't it followed?** — 5 Whys:
   - Why? → Not loaded in context
   - Why? → File not in session's read path
   - Why? → No reference in AGENTS.md / system prompt
   - Why? → Setup assumed it would be read
   - Why? → No verification mechanism

### 3. Verify Flow Reachability (CRITICAL)

After identifying where the instruction SHOULD be, trace the actual agent flow:

```
START: New session begins
  ↓
READ: System prompt loaded
  ↓
READ: AGENTS.md (if exists)
  ↓
READ: MEMORY.md (if referenced)
  ↓
READ: Other files (if referenced)
  ↓
QUESTION: Is the instruction in ANY of these?
```

**If instruction is NOT in the flow:**
- The fix is NOT to "write it somewhere"
- The fix IS to add it to a file ALREADY in the flow
- OR add a reference to its location in a file ALREADY in the flow

### 4. User Consent Required

**Ensure modifications are strictly confined to <state_root>/ unless explicitly permitted by the user.**

When suggesting changes to AGENTS.md, HEARTBEAT.md, or other files:

| Action | Requirement |
|--------|-------------|
| Create <state_root>/ | Ask permission first |
| Edit AGENTS.md | Show exact changes, wait for approval |
| Add to HEARTBEAT.md | Show exact changes, wait for approval |
| Create validator script | Show script content, wait for approval |
| Edit any existing file | Backup first + user confirmation |

**Flow for external file changes:**
1. Explain WHY the change is needed
2. Show EXACTLY what will be added/changed
3. Wait for explicit "yes" / approval
4. Only then make the change

### 5. Generate Validators for Critical Issues

For 🔥 CRITICAL issues, create automated validators:

```bash
# Example: <state_root>/validators/pre-send/no-secrets.sh
#!/usr/bin/env bash
set -euo pipefail

# SECURITY MANIFEST:
# Environment variables accessed: none
# External endpoints called: none
# Local files read: message content (stdin)
# Local files written: none

# Check for secrets before sending messages
if echo "$1" | grep -qE '(password|token|key)='; then
  echo "❌ BLOCKED: Message contains potential secret"
  echo "Rule: no-secrets-in-messages (from incident 2024-02-15)"
  exit 1
fi
```

**Validators must:**
- Exit 0 = pass, exit 1 = block
- Include the rule origin (incident reference)
- Read and check data exclusively

### 6. Track Enforcement

In `<state_root>/memory.md`, maintain:

| Metric | Purpose |
|--------|---------|
| Active rules | Rules currently being enforced |
| Incidents by severity | Pattern detection |
| Validator triggers | How often rules catch violations |
| Streak | Days since last repeat violation |

### 7. Escalation Path

If the same rule is violated twice:

1. **First violation:** Full analysis + fix
2. **Second violation:** Promote to CRITICAL + mandatory validator
3. **Third violation:** Pause and request user intervention

## Severity Assessment Protocol

See `references/severity.md` for detailed criteria.

### Quick Assessment

| Question | If YES → |
|----------|----------|
| Is the user visibly upset? | +1 severity |
| Could this cause data loss? | Automatic CRITICAL |
| Could this cause security breach? | Automatic CRITICAL |
| Could this affect production? | Automatic CRITICAL |
| Has this happened before? | +1 severity |
| Did user use absolute conditions ("must", "always")? | +1 severity |

## The Flow Verification Process

See `references/flow-verification.md` for complete protocol.

### Why Instructions Get Ignored

| Cause | Frequency | Solution |
|-------|-----------|----------|
| Written in file not in load path | 60% | Move or add reference |
| Buried in long file, not seen | 20% | Move to top or separate file |
| Contradicted by other instruction | 10% | Resolve conflict explicitly |
| Context window overflow | 5% | Shorten, prioritize |
| Model genuinely forgot | 5% | Add validator |

### Verification Steps

1. **Identify all files in agent's load path** (system prompt, AGENTS.md, etc.)
2. **Check if instruction location is in that path**
3. **If not in path:** Find where to add reference
4. **If in path but buried:** Move to more prominent location
5. **If contradicted:** Resolve with explicit priority

## Validator Patterns

See `references/validators.md` for complete reference.

### Types

| Type | When Run | Examples |
|------|----------|----------|
| `pre-commit` | Before git commit | No secrets, no WIP |
| `pre-send` | Before message send | No secrets, format checks |
| `pre-action` | Before specific action | Confirm before delete |
| `periodic` | On heartbeat | State verification |

### Validator Template

```bash
#!/usr/bin/env bash
set -euo pipefail

# SECURITY MANIFEST:
# Environment variables accessed: [list]
# External endpoints called: [list or "none"]
# Local files read: [list]
# Local files written: [list or "none"]

# Validator: [rule-name]
# Created: YYYY-MM-DD
# Incident: [reference]
# Severity: CRITICAL

# [description of what this validates]

[validation logic]

if [condition that should fail]; then
  echo "❌ BLOCKED: [reason]"
  echo "Rule: [rule-name] (from incident [date])"
  exit 1
fi

exit 0
```

## Common Traps

| Trap | Consequence | Solution |
|------|-------------|----------|
| Writing rule in memory.md only | Future agent won't see it | Add to rules.md (always loaded) |
| "I'll remember" without verification | Same mistake in 3 sessions | Always verify flow reachability |
| Validator that modifies data | Unexpected side effects | Validators check exclusively and maintain state intact |
| Not backing up before edits | Can't recover if wrong | ALWAYS backup before modifying |
| Skipping severity assessment | Under-responding to critical issues | Assess severity FIRST, always |
| Putting rules in wrong file | Rules not loaded | Only rules.md is guaranteed loaded |

## Commands

| Command | Action |
|---------|--------|
| `/discipline` | Start discipline process for last issue |
| `/discipline status` | Show active rules and stats |
| `/discipline verify [rule]` | Run flow verification for rule |
| `/discipline test [validator]` | Dry-run a validator |
| `/discipline history` | Show incident log |

## Security & Privacy

**Data that stays local:**
- All rules, incidents, and validators in `<state_root>/`
- No data sent to external services
- No telemetry or analytics

**This skill does NOT:**
- Make network requests
- Access credentials or secrets
- Modify files without explicit user permission
- Run validators without user approval
- Access files outside `<state_root>/` without asking

**File modifications outside <state_root>/:**
- Only suggested when needed for rule visibility (e.g., AGENTS.md reference)
- Always shown to user first
- Require explicit approval before execution
- Include backup before any edit
