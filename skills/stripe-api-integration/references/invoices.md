# Invoices, Quotes, and the Billing Portal

**Read `## Account Context` and `tax_handling`** in `<state_root>/stripe-api-integration/memory.md` and `config.yaml` before issuing anything: the entity details and tax registrations are printed on the document, and fixing them afterwards means a credit note.

## Finalization Is the Point of No Return

An invoice is a `draft` you can change freely, and then a legal document you cannot.

| State | Editable? | How you leave it |
|---|---|---|
| `draft` | Yes — add, remove, reprice line items | Finalize (automatically ~1 hour after creation for subscription invoices, or explicitly) |
| `open` | No | Paid, voided, or marked uncollectible |
| `paid` | No | Refund the payment and issue a credit note |
| `void` | No | Terminal; the number stays used |
| `uncollectible` | No | An accounting statement, not a deletion |

Consequences: **fix draft invoices, but not finalized ones.** After finalization the instrument is a credit note, which is a separate document with its own number, and the tax effect follows the credit note rather than the refund (`invoices.md`). Numbering must stay sequential without gaps, which is exactly why voiding is supported and deleting is not.

`collection_method` decides who chases the money: `charge_automatically` charges the saved payment method, `send_invoice` emails a hosted invoice page with `days_until_due` and waits. B2B usually wants the second, and the second means dunning is a human process, not a retry schedule.

## The Billing Portal Replaces Most Support Tickets

A configured portal lets customers update their card, change plan within the options you allow, view invoices and cancel — the four requests that otherwise arrive by email. The configuration is the policy: which plan changes are permitted, whether cancellation is immediate or at period end, whether a cancellation reason is collected. Making cancellation hard here converts churn into disputes, which cost more (`payments.md`).

## ID Prefixes Reference

| Prefix | Resource |

| `sub_sched_` | Subscription Schedule |
| `mtr_` | Meter |

**Write in the same turn**: invoice numbering conventions, `collection_method` per customer type and the portal policy go to `## Integration Shape` in `<state_root>/stripe-api-integration/memory.md` (or under `conventions` in `config.yaml` when the user states them as rules). A client you invoice is a person: their record goes to `<state_root>/contacts/contacts.md` and is referenced here by name only. A quote template or a collections procedure worth reusing is `artifacts/<name>.md` with its `## Boxes` line.
