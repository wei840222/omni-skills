# Customers, Products, Prices, Coupons

**Read `## Catalog` in `<state_root>/stripe-api-integration/memory.md`** (or `customers.md` when `## Boxes` points there) before creating anything here: the price id that already exists, and the one it replaced, are the two facts nobody can reconstruct from memory.

## Object Rules That Bite Later

- **Stripe allows duplicate customers with the same email, and will happily create one per checkout.** Look the customer up by your own key before creating — a customer created twice is a subscription the Billing Portal cannot show, an invoice history split in half, and a support ticket you cannot answer. Search is eventually consistent, so the lookup belongs in your database, not in Stripe (`advanced.md`).
- **A price is effectively immutable**: amount, currency, interval and tier structure are frozen once it exists. Changing what you charge means creating a new price and migrating deliberately (`subscriptions.md`).
- **Deleting is archiving.** Products and prices that have been used are deactivated, not removed, and live subscriptions keep billing on a deactivated price. That is correct behavior and it is why retired rows stay in the catalog with their date.
- **Metadata does not propagate.** A customer's metadata is not on their invoices; set it where you will read it (`advanced.md`).
- The customer's `invoice_settings[default_payment_method]` is what subscriptions charge. Attaching a payment method without setting it is the most common cause of a renewal that fails against nothing (`subscriptions.md`).
- Tax id, billing address and name on the customer object are what appear on the invoice. Collect them at checkout or credit-note your way back later (`invoices.md`).

**Write in the same turn** any product, price, coupon or promotion code created, retired or replaced: its row goes to `## Catalog` in `<state_root>/stripe-api-integration/memory.md` with the id, the model, the amount with its currency, the interval and what it replaced. Count the entries first — past ~15, split the section to `customers.md` before appending and add its `## Boxes` line (`memory-template.md`). A named client behind a customer record goes to `<state_root>/contacts/contacts.md`, referenced here by name only.
