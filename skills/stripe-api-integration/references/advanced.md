# Advanced Products — Issuing, Terminal, Treasury, Identity, Radar

Issuing (virtual/physical cards), Terminal (POS), Treasury (banking), Identity (verification), Radar (fraud), Financial Connections, Climate, Sigma.

**Read `## Account Context` in `<state_root>/stripe-api-integration/memory.md`** (or its box) first: every product here needs separate activation, most carry their own pricing, and several impose regulatory obligations that are not undoable. None of them is a feature flag.

## Before Enabling Any of These

| Product | What it really commits you to |
|---|---|
| Issuing | You are handing out spending power. Authorization decisions, cardholder disputes, funding the card balance, and program-level obligations |
| Terminal | Physical hardware in physical places: readers, locations, network, staff, and the loss of the "it works on my machine" defence |
| Treasury | Financial accounts on top of a bank partner: KYC, money movement rules, and a compliance surface far beyond payments |
| Identity | Collecting government identity documents — the most sensitive data in this whole skill, with retention rules to match |
| Radar for Fraud Teams | Priced per screened payment; rules you write can block real customers silently |
| Financial Connections | Access to the customer's bank data, with consent and scope obligations |
| Sigma | SQL over your account data; an analysis tool, never part of a request path |

Two rules cut across all of them: **the fee line belongs in `<state_root>/finances/subscriptions.md`** alongside other paid add-ons, so unit economics stay honest; and **the sensitive artifacts these products produce — cardholder data, identity documents, bank credentials — are never written under `<state_root>/`**, only their ids and pointers (`memory-template.md`).

## Radar, Practically

Radar runs on every payment whether or not you pay for the rules engine. The judgment that matters is not which rules exist but how you tune them:

- **Block narrow shapes, not broad categories.** Blocking a country blocks its legitimate customers too; blocking "this BIN range plus this email pattern plus mismatched country" blocks the attack.
- **Review the review queue.** A rule that flags for manual review with nobody reviewing is a rule that silently delays revenue.
- **Measure both errors.** False positives are lost sales that never complain; false negatives are disputes. Only the second is visible by default, which is why teams over-tighten.
- **Allow lists are for known-good customers you keep declining**, and they are a liability if they outlive their reason — date them.
- **A rule set that finally worked belongs in `<state_root>/stripe-api-integration/artifacts/radar-rules.md`** with what it was blocking and what it cost, plus its `## Boxes` line — otherwise the next person re-derives it from disputes.

## Issuing, Practically

Real-time authorization decisions are a webhook with a deadline: the handler approves or declines within a very short window, and a slow handler produces a declined card in someone's hand. Design it as the fastest path in your system, with a safe default when your own systems are unavailable — and decide deliberately whether that default is approve or decline, because both are expensive in different ways.

## Terminal, Practically

Readers are physical assets with locations, network dependencies and firmware. The failure modes are logistical rather than logical: a reader on the wrong location object, a network that blocks the reader's traffic, a firmware update mid-shift. Connection tokens are single-use credentials and are not stored.

**Write in the same turn**: enabling any product here goes to `## Account Context` in `<state_root>/stripe-api-integration/memory.md` with the date, and its recurring cost to `<state_root>/finances/subscriptions.md` with the currency. Physical Terminal readers are devices: one row each in `<state_root>/devices/devices.md` (name, model, location, network, `tmr_` reference) — read the file first and update in place if the reader is already there. A Radar rule set that worked, or an Issuing authorization policy, is `artifacts/<name>.md` with its `## Boxes` line; a card or identity incident is a row in `incidents/<year>.md`.
