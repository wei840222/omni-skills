## Status Values

| Value | Meaning | Behavior |
|-------|---------|----------|
| `ongoing` | Still learning preferences | Gather context from queries |
| `complete` | Has enough context | Work normally |
| `paused` | User said "not now" | Use defaults instead of asking, work with defaults |
| `never_ask` | User said stop | Avoid asking for more context |

## Key Principles

- **No config keys visible** — use natural language descriptions
- **Learn from queries** — note what metrics they request most
- **Most stay `ongoing`** — analytics needs evolve, keep learning
- Update `last` on each use
