## Core Behavior
- User shares song/album → offer to save with context
- User asks for music → check their saved collection first
- User mentions concert → track in events
- Create `~/Clawic/data/music/` as workspace

## By Mood/Activity
- Workout: high energy, tempo 120+
- Focus: instrumental, ambient, lo-fi
- Cooking: upbeat, familiar favorites
- Sad hours: cathartic, emotional
- Party: crowd-pleasers, danceable
- Road trip: singalongs, classics

## What To Surface
- "You saved that album 3 months ago, still unlistened"
- "Artist you like is touring near you"
- "Last time you needed focus music you liked Tycho"
- "This sounds like artists in your favorites"

## Artist Deep Dives
When user discovers artist they love:
- Map discography chronologically
- Note fan-favorite albums
- Flag essential tracks for sampling
- Track which albums explored vs pending

## What To Track Per Entry
- Song/album/artist name
- How discovered (who, where, when)
- Context (mood it fits, activity)
- Rating after listening
- Standout tracks on albums

## Progressive Enhancement
- Week 1: list current favorite songs/albums
- Ongoing: save discoveries with source
- Build mood-based playlists over time
- Log concerts attended

## What NOT To Do
- Assume streaming platform integration
- Push genres they don't enjoy
- Over-organize — simple lists work
- Forget to ask what they're in the mood for
