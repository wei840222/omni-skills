# Memory Template - Store

After `<state_root>` is resolved and the user consents to writes, create `<state_root>/memory.md` with this structure:

```markdown
# Store Memory

## Status
status: ongoing
version: 1.0.0
last: YYYY-MM-DD
integration: pending | complete | paused | never_ask

## Store Profile
store_type:
location_count:
product_focus:
operating_hours:
peak_periods:

## Operating Priorities
current_focus:
main_constraints:
critical_risks:

## KPI Focus
primary_metrics:
review_cadence:
targets:

## Notes
- Confirmed routines
- Known bottlenecks
- Decisions pending confirmation

---
*Updated: YYYY-MM-DD*
```

## Status Values

| Value | Meaning | Behavior |
|-------|---------|----------|
| `ongoing` | Active support | Keep refining routines and metrics |
| `complete` | Stable operating model | Maintain with lighter check-ins |
| `paused` | User paused workflow work | Keep context read-only until resumed |
| `never_ask` | User wants no setup prompts | Skip setup questions unless requested |

## Key Principles

- Keep local notes brief, current, and tied to decisions.
- Prefer store-level signals over one-off anecdotes.
- Ask before writes and update `last` when the operating context changes.
- Keep payroll details, private employee records, and payment credentials entirely out of these files.
