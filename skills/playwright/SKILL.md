User preferences and memory live in `~/Clawic/data/playwright/` (see `setup.md` on first use). If you have data at an old location (`~/playwright/` or `~/clawic/playwright/`), move it to `~/Clawic/data/playwright/`, and say in one line that you moved it and from where. Everything a run produces — specs, traces, reports, snapshots, `storageState` files — stays inside the repository or its temp dir, never in the preferences folder: auth state is a credential and belongs in a gitignored path.

## When To Use

- Writing or repairing Playwright specs, fixtures, `playwright.config.ts`, or one-off automation scripts
- A run fails: timeout, strict mode violation, flaky click, passes locally and fails in CI or headless
- Login, session reuse, uploads, downloads, iframes, popups, dialogs, or device emulation are in the way
- Visual snapshots, accessibility checks, trace capture, sharding, or cutting suite wall time
- Driving a live browser through Playwright MCP, or extracting data a plain fetch cannot render
- Porting a Cypress, Puppeteer, or Selenium suite to Playwright, including deciding which tests not to port
- Not for maintaining an existing Cypress or Puppeteer suite (→ `cypress`, `puppeteer`) or for anything an HTTP request already answers (→ `http`)

## Quick Reference

| Situation | Play |
|---|---|
| `strict mode violation: resolved to N elements` | Narrow with `.filter({ hasText })` or a parent chain — never `.nth()` unless position is the behavior under test → `selectors.md` |
| `Timeout 30000ms exceeded waiting for locator` | The locator never matched. Trace it, do not raise the timeout → `debugging.md` |
| `element is not visible` / `intercepts pointer events` | An overlay, animation, or disabled state — `force: true` hides the bug → `waiting.md` |
| Test needs a `waitForTimeout` to pass | Replace with a web-first assertion on the state you were sleeping for → `waiting.md` |
| Green locally, red in CI (or only headless) | Compare viewport, workers, timezone, animations, and browser build → `flake.md`, `ci-cd.md` |
| Passes alone, fails in the suite | Shared account, shared server data, or leaked storage — isolate per worker → `auth.md` |
| Same test red 1 run in 20 | Measure before fixing: `--repeat-each`, then classify by cause → `flake.md` |
| Login repeated in every test | Sign in once in a setup project, reuse `storageState` → `auth.md` |
| A test passes while the feature is broken, or nobody knows what deserves an E2E | What earns a test, outcome assertions, skip and fixme annotations → `testing.md` |
| Writing `playwright.config.ts`, adding a project, a setting that will not apply | Config anatomy, precedence, projects, `webServer`, tags → `config.md` |
| Setup repeated in every test, page objects, or where test data comes from | Test- and worker-scoped fixtures, page-object rules, data strategy → `fixtures.md` |
| Third party, payment sandbox, or slow API in the path | Intercept with `page.route`, or record and replay a HAR → `network.md` |
| Upload, download, PDF, or drag-and-drop | Event-first patterns (`waitForEvent('download')`, `setInputFiles`) → `files.md` |
| New tab, popup, `window.alert`, geolocation, dark mode, offline | Context-level control; dialogs auto-dismiss unless handled → `contexts.md` |
| Screenshot diff passes locally, fails on the runner | Snapshots are per-platform; generate them where CI runs → `visual.md` |
| WCAG or keyboard-navigation coverage | axe scan plus real keyboard assertions → `accessibility.md` |
| Suite takes too long | Measure the slowest tests first, then parallelize or seed via API → `performance.md` |
| Browser missing, wrong channel, WebKit-only failure | Version-locked browsers and engine differences → `browsers.md` |
| Agent should click through a live site now | Snapshot-driven MCP browser control → `mcp.md` |
| Pull data from a JS-rendered page | Bounded extraction with throttling → `scraping.md` |
| Porting from Cypress, Puppeteer, or Selenium | Translation table and the habits to drop → `migration.md` |
| Anything else | Reproduce headed with a trace (`npx playwright test <file> --headed --trace on`), open the trace, and read the DOM snapshot at the failing step |

CLI toolkit: `commands.md`. First-use preference loading: `setup.md`.

## Core Rules

1. **Locate by what the user perceives.** Order: role/label/text → test ID → CSS/XPath. `getByRole('button', { name: 'Submit' })` survives a class rename and a CSS-in-JS rebuild; `.css-1a2b3c` does not. Test IDs are a contract you own — fine, but they assert nothing about accessibility.
2. **Never sleep; assert.** `page.waitForTimeout(500)` is simultaneously too slow on a fast run and too short on a loaded runner. Web-first assertions re-check until the expect timeout (5 s default) and stop the moment the condition holds — strictly faster and strictly more reliable.
3. **Budget the timeouts, do not inflate them.** Defaults: test 30 000 ms, expect 5 000 ms, action and navigation 0 (unbounded, so the test timeout is the real ceiling), `webServer` 60 000 ms. Sizing rule: sum the slowest legitimate path, measured not guessed, and keep the total inside the 30 000 ms default — login 4 s + dashboard render 8 s + one 5 s assertion = 17 s, comfortably inside 30 s. When one step is genuinely slow, raise that assertion's `timeout`, not the global test timeout: a global bump turns every real hang into a 2-minute wait.
4. **One test, one fresh context, one account it owns.** Playwright gives each test a new browser context; that resets cookies and storage but not your database. With N workers, allocate N accounts and index them by `parallelIndex` — sharing one mutable user makes failures order-dependent, and order-dependent failures are unfixable by reading the diff.
5. **Capture before you rewrite.** For any failure you did not cause in the last edit, get a trace first (`trace: 'on-first-retry'`, or `--trace on` for one run). Rewriting a locator against a symptom you never observed is how a two-line bug becomes a rewritten suite.
6. **Retries buy green builds and hide the bill.** A per-test failure probability p across N tests makes a full run red with probability 1 − (1 − p)^N: p = 0.005 across 300 tests → 78% of runs red. Two retries mask that, but the flake is still there and now costs 3× wall time on every occurrence. Keep retries, and track the flaky count as a number that must go down (`flake.md`).
7. **Mock what you do not own; seed through the API, click through the UI only for what is under test.** Creating a user by API and starting the test on the target page removes minutes and removes the upstream service from your failure surface. Exception: the integration itself is the thing being verified.
8. **Treat production and destructive flows as opt-in.** Automating a real payment, deletion, or email send needs the user to say so in this session; default to local or staging. `storageState` files are live credentials — gitignore them and never write one into a shared or synced folder.
9. **Pin the browsers to the Playwright version.** Browser builds ship with the package, so `mcr.microsoft.com/playwright:vX.Y.Z-*` must match the installed `@playwright/test` exactly, and a CI cache key must include that version. A mismatch surfaces as `Executable doesn't exist at .../ms-playwright/...` or, worse, as a silent behavior difference.

## Failure Signatures

Read the first line of the error before anything else; it names the subsystem.

| Message | Real cause | First move |
|---|---|---|
| `strict mode violation: ... resolved to 3 elements` | The locator describes a category, not an element | Filter or chain (`selectors.md`); the error lists the matches — read them |
| `Timeout 30000ms exceeded. waiting for locator(...)` | Never matched: wrong frame, wrong name, not rendered | Trace → DOM snapshot at that step (`debugging.md`) |
| `waiting for element to be visible, enabled and stable` | Matched but not actionable: animation, overlay, `disabled` | `waiting.md` actionability table — not `force: true` |
| `element intercepts pointer events` | Another node covers the target (cookie banner, toast, modal backdrop) | Dismiss it in a fixture; the banner is real user-facing state |
| `Test timeout of 30000ms exceeded while running "beforeEach" hook` | Setup, not the test, is slow or hanging | Move it to a setup project or fixture with its own timeout |
| `Target page, context or browser has been closed` | Action after `close()`, or the process crashed mid-run | Check for a crash in the worker log; in Docker suspect `/dev/shm` (`ci-cd.md`) |
| `Executable doesn't exist at .../ms-playwright/...` | Browsers not installed or version-mismatched | `npx playwright install --with-deps` at the pinned version (rule 9) |
| `net::ERR_CONNECTION_REFUSED` | App not up, wrong port, or `webServer` exited | `webServer` block plus `reuseExistingServer: !process.env.CI` |
| `net::ERR_CERT_AUTHORITY_INVALID` | Self-signed cert on staging or a corporate MITM proxy | `ignoreHTTPSErrors: true` scoped to that project only |
| Screenshot comparison failed, `-linux.png` missing | Snapshots are keyed by platform and project | Generate baselines on the CI platform (`visual.md`) |
| No error, test passes, feature is broken | Asserted on the command, not the outcome | Assert user-visible state (`testing.md`) |

## Isolation Model

What resets, and when — the mental model behind most "it only fails in the suite" bugs.

| Layer | Cost to create | Resets | Leaks across tests |
|---|---|---|---|
| Browser | Expensive; one per worker, reused | Nothing between tests | Yes, by design |
| Context | Cheap; new one per test by default | Cookies, localStorage, sessionStorage, permissions, service workers | No |
| Page | Cheapest; many per context | Nothing (shares the context jar) | Within the test only |
| Worker process | Restarted after a failure and on retry | Worker fixtures re-run | Module-level globals inside one worker |
| Server, database, mailbox | Not managed by Playwright | Nothing | **Yes — this is the real leak** |

Consequences: `fullyParallel: true` runs tests inside one file across workers, so file-level ordering guarantees vanish. `test.describe.serial` restores order but skips the remaining tests on the first failure and re-runs the whole group on retry. A retried test starts in a fresh worker — which is exactly why some flake "fixes itself" on retry and tells you the leak was in-process.

## Output Gates

Before delivering a spec, script, or config:

- Zero `waitForTimeout` used for synchronization and zero `networkidle` waits — each replaced by an assertion on the state being waited for (a politeness delay in extraction is the only exception, `scraping.md`)?
- Every locator resolves to exactly one element, without `.first()`/`.nth()` standing in for a real filter?
- Assertions check user-visible outcomes (text, URL, enabled state, download), not that a call returned?
- No shared mutable account or shared seed data between tests that can run in parallel?
- Trace configured (`on-first-retry` at minimum) and failure artifacts uploaded in CI?
- No credential, token, or `storageState` path committed; production URLs absent unless the user asked for them?
- Runs headless on a clean checkout with browsers installed at the pinned version?

## Configuration

User-dependent variables. Defaults apply until the user states a preference; store them in `~/Clawic/data/playwright/config.yaml`.

| Variable | Type | Default | Effect |
|---|---|---|---|
| language | typescript \| javascript | typescript | Language of every emitted spec, config, and snippet; switches `playwright.config.ts` to `.js` and drops type imports |
| runner_mode | test \| script \| mcp | test | Which path Quick Reference proposes first: `@playwright/test` suite, standalone Playwright script, or MCP browser control |
| default_browsers | list (chromium, firefox, webkit) | chromium | Projects written into config and the engines assumed when diagnosing a failure (`browsers.md`) |
| cross_browser_cadence | pr \| nightly \| release | nightly | Which gate the non-default engines run at: every PR, a scheduled run, or release only — sets the matrix in `browsers.md` and the jobs written in `ci-cd.md` |
| headed_by_default | bool | false | Adds `--headed` to suggested commands and `headless: false` to launch options during exploration |
| test_id_attribute | string | data-testid | Value written to `testIdAttribute` and the attribute `getByTestId` examples use |
| ci_provider | github \| gitlab \| other | github | Which pipeline template `ci-cd.md` guidance is rendered for, including artifact and cache steps |
| scrape_delay_ms | number (0-60000) | 1000 | Minimum gap between page loads in multi-page extraction (`scraping.md` throttling) |

Preference areas — customizable dimensions; a stated preference gets recorded in `config.yaml` and applied:

- **Tooling** — package manager (`npm`/`pnpm`/`yarn`/`bun`) used in every command, UI mode vs CLI, codegen vs hand-written locators
- **Conventions** — spec layout and naming, page-object vs inline fixtures, tag vocabulary (`@smoke`, `@flaky`), assertion style
- **Platform** — browser channels (`chrome`, `msedge`), device emulation set, CI runner OS, official Docker image vs manual browser install
- **Safety posture** — whether non-local base URLs may be automated at all, confirmation before destructive or paid flows, how loudly to flag production targets
- **Flake policy** — retry count in CI, quarantine-and-file vs fix-before-merge, whether a flaky pass fails the build
- **Cadence** — what runs at which gate (PR, nightly, release), how often the `@integration` spec hits the real third party, how long a `@flaky` quarantine may last before the test is fixed or deleted, when a recorded HAR and an accessibility scan are refreshed
- **Extraction posture** — crawl breadth, robots and terms strictness, asset blocking, stop conditions
- **Output format** — reporter set (`list`, `html`, `blob`, `junit`), how much trace and video to retain, verbosity of failure summaries

## Traps

| Trap | Why it fails | Do instead |
|---|---|---|
| `force: true` to get past a failing click | Bypasses the actionability checks that were reporting a real overlay or disabled control — the test goes green while the user stays blocked | Find the blocker in the trace; dismiss banners in a fixture (`waiting.md`) |
| `waitForLoadState('networkidle')` | Analytics beacons, polling, and websockets keep an SPA "busy" forever; the docs discourage it | Assert on the element or response you actually need |
| `.first()` / `.nth(0)` to silence strict mode | Freezes an accidental DOM order; a new promo card at index 0 silently retargets the test | `.filter({ hasText })`, `.filter({ has })`, or scope to a parent |
| `page.$$eval` / `locator.all()` for lists | Neither auto-waits; both snapshot whatever exists at call time, so a slow render yields an empty array and a passing test | `await expect(list).toHaveCount(n)` first, then read |
| `locator.isVisible()` in an `if` | Returns immediately without retrying — the classic "works on my fast machine" conditional | `await expect(locator).toBeVisible()`, or `toBeHidden()` for the negative |
| Storing an `ElementHandle` across a re-render | The handle points at a detached node; locators re-resolve at action time, handles do not | Keep locators in variables; handles only when you need the raw node |
| One `storageState` for every test that mutates data | Parallel workers fight over the same server-side rows | One account per worker indexed by `parallelIndex` (`auth.md`) |
| Building the app's own page objects before any duplication exists | An abstraction layer nobody needed makes every future failure two files away from its cause | Inline first; extract on the third repeat (`fixtures.md`) |
| Locators reaching into an iframe | Locators pierce open shadow DOM but never an iframe boundary | `page.frameLocator(...)` / `locator.contentFrame()` (`selectors.md`) |
| Registering a `dialog` handler and forgetting to respond | The page hangs; without any handler Playwright auto-dismisses, so adding one changes behavior | Always `accept()` or `dismiss()` inside the handler (`contexts.md`) |
| Committing a suite that only passes headed | Headless differs in fonts, media codecs, and window size, and CI has no display | Run headless locally before handing off (`browsers.md`) |
| Driving a full browser to read static HTML | Slower, flakier, and a browser process per request for data a fetch returns | Try the HTTP path first (`scraping.md`, `http`) |

## Where Experts Disagree

- **Test IDs vs semantic locators.** Role and label locators double as an accessibility smoke test and break when the UI genuinely changes for users; test IDs never break and never tell you anything. Default: semantic first, test IDs for elements with no accessible name (icon buttons, list rows, canvas widgets). The boundary is whether the string a locator uses is one a user could perceive.
- **Retries in CI.** Two retries is the scaffolded default and keeps a large suite mergeable; the zero-retry camp argues every masked flake is a real race in the product. Workable line: retries on, flaky count reported and trending down, and no test allowed to stay flaky across two sprints.
- **How many E2E tests.** Pyramid says a handful of journeys; the trophy argues browser tests are the only ones that check what ships. Decide by cost: an E2E test that takes 20 s and catches a class of bug unit tests structurally cannot is worth it; one that re-tests validation logic is not.
- **Agent-driven browsing vs committed automation.** MCP is unbeatable for exploration and one-off tasks and leaves nothing reviewable behind. Anything that must run again next week gets written down as code (`mcp.md`).

## Security & Privacy

| Endpoint | Data sent | Purpose |
|---|---|---|
| Sites the user asks to automate | Navigation, form input, cookies, uploaded files, page interactions | The requested automation, testing, capture, or extraction |
| `https://registry.npmjs.org` | Package metadata and tarballs on install | Install Playwright or Playwright MCP |
| Playwright browser CDN (during `playwright install`) | Browser build downloads | Fetch the version-locked browser binaries |

This skill does NOT: persist sessions or credentials by default; write anything outside the repository except the preferences folder above; recommend fingerprint spoofing, CAPTCHA-solving services, or rotating exits; automate production, payment, or destructive flows without the user asking in the current session; or send page content anywhere beyond the sites involved in the task.

Guardrails: auth artifacts stay in a gitignored path and are never printed into logs or reports; traces and videos can contain tokens and personal data, so treat uploaded CI artifacts as sensitive and cap retention; extraction stays inside the scope the user named.
