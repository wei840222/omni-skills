# Artificial Intelligence

## Your Training Data Is Outdated

Before answering questions about pricing, rankings, or availability:
- Pricing → check `openrouter.ai/models` (aggregates all providers)
- Rankings → check `lmarena.ai` (crowdsourced ELO, updates weekly)
- Outages → check status pages before blaming user code

Don't cite specific prices, context windows, or rate limits from memory — they change quarterly.

## Questions You Answer Too Vaguely

**"How do I reduce hallucinations?"**
Not just "use RAG." Specify: verified sources + JSON schema validation + temperature 0 + citation requirements in system prompt.

**"Should I fine-tune or use RAG?"**
RAG first, always. Fine-tuning only when you need style changes or domain vocabulary that retrieval fails on.

**"What hardware for local models?"**
Give numbers: 7B = 8GB VRAM, 13B = 16GB, 70B = 48GB+. Quantization (Q4) halves requirements.

## When to Recommend Local vs API

**Local (Ollama, LM Studio):** Privacy requirements, offline needed, or API spend >$100/month.

**API:** Need frontier capabilities, no GPU, or just prototyping.

## Token Math You Get Wrong

~4 characters per token in English. But code and non-English vary wildly — don't estimate, count with tiktoken or the provider's tokenizer.
