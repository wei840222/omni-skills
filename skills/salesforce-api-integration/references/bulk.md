# Bulk API 2.0 — Volume Loads and Exports

**Before running a load**, read `<state_root>/loads/<year>.md` if the `## Boxes` index names it — a load of the same object has probably run before, and its row counts, mapping and failure list are the fastest way to predict this one. Read `## Gotchas` too: lock contention and validation-rule surprises are recorded there.

## When Bulk Is the Right Answer

| Records | Path | API calls |
|---|---|---|
| 1 | sObject REST (`references/records.md`) | 1 |
| 2 – 200 | sObject Collections (`references/composite.md`) | 1 |
| 200 – `bulk_threshold` (default 5,000) | Collections in a loop | `ceil(n ÷ 200)` |
| Above `bulk_threshold`, or the source is already a CSV | **Bulk 2.0** | ~5-10 regardless of volume |
| Anything a human is waiting on, under ~2,000 | Collections | Synchronous errors beat a results file |

Bulk trades immediacy for allocation: the job runs asynchronously, you poll, and the errors arrive as a file. That is the correct trade above a few thousand records and the wrong one below it.

## 2.0 vs 1.0

Use 2.0 unless a named 1.0 feature is required.

| | Bulk 2.0 | Bulk 1.0 |
|---|---|---|
| Batching | Automatic — upload one file, Salesforce splits it | Manual, you create and track batches |
| Retries | Salesforce retries transient failures | Yours to implement |
| Processing mode | Parallel only | Parallel **or serial** |
| Query chunking | Automatic | Manual, via the PK chunking header |
| Hard delete | Supported (`hardDelete` operation) | Supported |

The one reason to reach back for 1.0 is **serial mode**, when parallel chunks keep colliding on the same parent records and sorting the file has not fixed it.

## The Job Lifecycle

Four calls, always in this order.

```bash
# 1. Create the job
curl -X POST "$SF_INSTANCE_URL/services/data/v62.0/jobs/ingest" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer $SF_ACCESS_TOKEN" -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"operation":"upsert","object":"Account","externalIdFieldName":"ERP_Id__c",
       "contentType":"CSV","lineEnding":"LF"}'

# 2. Upload the data (the whole file, one PUT)
curl -X PUT "$SF_INSTANCE_URL/services/data/v62.0/jobs/ingest/750xx000000JOBID/batches" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer $SF_ACCESS_TOKEN" -H "Content-Type: text/csv" \
  --data-binary @accounts.csv

# 3. Close it — this is what starts processing
curl -X PATCH "$SF_INSTANCE_URL/services/data/v62.0/jobs/ingest/750xx000000JOBID" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer $SF_ACCESS_TOKEN" -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"state":"UploadComplete"}'

# 4. Poll until terminal
curl "$SF_INSTANCE_URL/services/data/v62.0/jobs/ingest/750xx000000JOBID" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer $SF_ACCESS_TOKEN"
```

Operations: `insert`, `update`, `upsert` (with `externalIdFieldName`), `delete`, `hardDelete`.

States: `Open` → `UploadComplete` → `InProgress` → `JobComplete`, with `Failed` and `Aborted` as the other terminals. **`JobComplete` does not mean every record succeeded** — it means the job finished. The counts are in `numberRecordsProcessed` and `numberRecordsFailed`, and the failures are a separate download.

A job left `Open` holds its data and never processes. A polling loop that forgets step 3 waits forever on a job nobody started.

Poll with backoff — every few seconds at first, then slower. Polling a long job every 500 ms spends more API calls on the poll than on the load.

## CSV Rules That Decide Success

- **Column headers are field API names**, not labels. `Account Name` fails; `Name` works; a custom field is `Region__c`.
- **`lineEnding` must match the file**: `LF` for Unix, `CRLF` for anything produced on Windows or by Excel. A mismatch corrupts the last column of every row, which shows up as a validation error on a field you never touched.
- **Empty cell = leave unchanged. `#N/A` = set to null.** This is the single most consequential convention in the API, and it is the opposite of what most loaders assume.
- **Compound fields are not supported.** `BillingAddress`, `MailingAddress` and geolocation fields must be sent as their components: `BillingStreet`, `BillingCity`, `BillingState`, `BillingPostalCode`, `BillingCountry`.
- Quote any value containing a comma, quote or newline, doubling internal quotes (`"He said ""no"""`). A single unescaped newline shifts every subsequent row.
- Dates: `YYYY-MM-DD`; date-times: ISO 8601 with an explicit offset (`2026-06-15T14:30:00.000+0000`). A date-time without an offset is interpreted in the org's timezone, which moves records across day boundaries in reports.
- Booleans are `true`/`false`; picklists take the API value, not the label.
- UTF-8, no BOM. A BOM turns the first column header into an unrecognized field.
- The file must include the fields required by the object *and* by the org's validation rules — the API applies no page-layout defaults (`references/records.md`).

## Lookups Without Salesforce Ids

A Bulk CSV can resolve a relationship through the parent's external id, which removes the entire "query for parent ids first" step:

```csv
LastName,Email,Account.ERP_Id__c
Ruiz,dana@acme.example,EXT-4471
```

The column is `<RelationshipName>.<ExternalIdField>` — the relationship name, not the object name (`Account` for the standard lookup, `Shipment__r` for a custom one). Every parent must already exist; unresolved keys fail those rows with `INVALID_CROSS_REFERENCE_KEY` and leave the rest loaded.

## Lock Contention (the signature Bulk failure)

Parallel chunks that touch the same parent record fight for its lock and lose: `UNABLE_TO_LOCK_ROW` on a fraction of rows, different rows each run.

Causes, in order of frequency: child records sharing a parent (Contacts under one Account), master-detail rollups recalculating, ownership changes cascading sharing recalculation, and two jobs against related objects running at once.

Fixes, in order to try:

1. **Sort the file by the parent id or parent external id.** Chunks are cut sequentially, so sorting puts one parent's children in one chunk and the contention disappears. This fixes most cases and costs one `sort`.
2. Run related jobs one at a time instead of in parallel.
3. Fall back to Bulk 1.0 serial mode.
4. For mass ownership changes, ask the admin to enable deferred sharing calculation for the window (a dependency-ordered migration plan).

Record the fix in `## Gotchas`: the same load will run again next quarter.

## Reading the Results

```bash
curl "$SF_INSTANCE_URL/services/data/v62.0/jobs/ingest/750xx000000JOBID/failedResults" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer $SF_ACCESS_TOKEN"
```

Three downloads: `successfulResults`, `failedResults`, `unprocessedrecords`. Each is a CSV echoing your original columns plus `sf__Id` and, for failures, `sf__Error`.

- **Always download `failedResults`.** A job reported as complete with 4% failures is a silent data-quality incident otherwise.
- The failure file is a valid input file: fix the offending columns and re-upload it as a new job. With upsert this is safe to repeat.
- `unprocessedrecords` appears when a job was aborted or hit a limit mid-flight — those records were never attempted.
- Result files are retained for a limited window and then deleted with the job; download before you close the ticket.

## Bulk Query (export)

```bash
curl -X POST "$SF_INSTANCE_URL/services/data/v62.0/jobs/query" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer $SF_ACCESS_TOKEN" -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"operation":"query","query":"SELECT Id, Name, ERP_Id__c FROM Account"}'

curl "$SF_INSTANCE_URL/services/data/v62.0/jobs/query/750xx000000JOBID/results?maxRecords=50000" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer $SF_ACCESS_TOKEN"
```

- `operation: queryAll` includes deleted and archived records.
- Results paginate through the `Sforce-Locator` response header; pass it back as the `locator` parameter until the header comes back empty. Missing this is why an export "only returned the first chunk".
- Bulk 2.0 chunks large exports itself. The manual PK-chunking header belongs to Bulk 1.0 and is only needed there.
- A Bulk export of ten million rows still runs the SOQL: an unselective filter times out here too (`references/soql.md`).

## Hard Delete

`operation: "hardDelete"` bypasses the recycle bin. It requires the "Bulk API Hard Delete" user permission, cannot be undone, and is the only way to free storage immediately.

Gate it: state the exact record count, confirm explicitly, and refuse entirely when `safety_posture.hard_delete` is `forbidden`. Export the ids to `<state_root>/loads/<year>.md` first — after a hard delete, the only record that those rows existed is the one you wrote.

## Limits

- 150 MB per upload. Split larger files; the job accepts one PUT.
- Records are processed in chunks, so **Apex governor limits still apply per chunk** (≤200 records, 100 SOQL, 150 DML, 10s CPU). A trigger that is fine for one record can fail an entire load (`SKILL.md` Rule 5).
- Daily record ceilings for ingest are large but finite and vary by edition — read `/limits` rather than trusting a number in a document (`/limits`).
- Concurrent query jobs are capped in the low tens per org; queued jobs wait rather than fail.

## Bulk Traps

| Trap | Why it fails | Do instead |
|---|---|---|
| Testing with 10 rows | Never crosses a 200-record chunk boundary, so governor and lock failures cannot appear | Rehearse with ≥1,000 rows in a sandbox (`SKILL.md` Rule 8) |
| Empty cells to clear fields | Means "unchanged"; the old values stay | `#N/A` |
| Excel-exported CSV with `lineEnding: LF` | Excel writes CRLF; the last column carries a stray `\r` | Set `lineEnding: CRLF`, or normalize the file |
| Assuming `JobComplete` means success | It means finished | Read `numberRecordsFailed`, download `failedResults` |
| Re-running the whole file after partial failure | Re-processes everything and duplicates on insert jobs | Re-upload the failure file, and use upsert so repeats are safe |
| Bulk-loading during business hours | Locks, sharing recalculation and trigger load hit real users | Off-hours window, agreed in advance |
| One giant job for related objects | Parents and children in flight together maximizes contention | One job per object, in dependency order (a dependency-ordered migration plan) |
| Leaving the job `Open` | Nothing processes and nothing errors | PATCH to `UploadComplete` |

**After every job**, append a row to `<state_root>/loads/<year>.md`: date, object, operation, rows in, succeeded, failed, job id, and the one-line cause of the failures. Create the file and its `## Boxes` line in the same turn if it does not exist. If the failure taught you something about the org, add it to `## Gotchas`; if the mapping is one that will be reused, it belongs in `<state_root>/artifacts/mapping-<source>.md`.
