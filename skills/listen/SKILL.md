description: Repairs garbled speech-to-text input. Load when voice-dictated text contains
  mistranscribed names, domain jargon, numbers, punctuation errors, or when a user
  corrects an earlier dictation.

Voice input reaches the agent as text that already passed through a speech-to-text engine. Good engines hold 5-10% word error rate on clean conversational English, but the errors concentrate exactly where meaning lives: proper nouns, domain jargon, and numbers. This skill is the repair layer between the raw transcript and your response. Learned corrections and preferences persist in `<state_root>/` (see `references/setup.md` on first use, `references/lexicon.md` for the file formats). If you have data at an old location (`~/listen/` or `~/clawic/listen/`), move it to `<state_root>/`, and say in one line that you moved it and from where.

## When To Use

- A message arrived via voice and one token breaks the sentence ("deploy the communities cluster")
- The user repeats, rephrases, or says "no, I said X" after your response or action
- The same name, product, or term gets mangled across sessions and needs a persistent fix
- The user dictates an artifact by voice — an email, message, document, or note
- A voice command feeds an action with side effects (send, delete, book, pay) and a token looks off — repairs that change the target of such an action are always confirmed with the user before anything runs (Rule 1)
- A transcript arrives noisy, truncated, mixed-language, or padded with hallucinated sentences
- An STT engine needs vocabulary tuning for a user's recurring domain terms
- Not for transcribing audio files (that is batch transcription work) and not for typed-text typos: keyboard errors are adjacency-based, so phonetic repair misfires on them

## Quick Reference

| Transcript signal | Likely cause | Play |
|---|---|---|
| Common word breaks the sentence's domain | Proper noun replaced by frequent vocabulary | Phonetic match against lexicon, then session context (`references/repair.md`) |
| Number gates an action (amount, count, time) | -teen/-ty confusion (13/30 ... 19/90) | Echo the number as digits in your reply; confirm before irreversible acts (`references/numbers.md`) |
| "at", "dot", "dash", "underscore" around a name | Spoken email address or URL | Reassemble as an address and echo it back (`references/numbers.md`) |
| User re-sends a nearly identical sentence | Your previous reading was wrong | Diff the two versions; the changed token is the correction; log the pair |
| "period", "comma", "new line" mid-text | Spoken punctuation | Dictating an artifact: treat as command. Conversing: treat as literal word (`references/dictation.md`) |
| "scratch that", "no wait", "I mean" mid-dictation | Spoken self-correction | Apply the rewrite; keep only the final version (`references/dictation.md`) |
| Two words that read as one, or one as two | Segmentation error ("a track" / "attack") | Re-split at syllable boundaries before declaring the token unknown (`references/repair.md`) |
| Word fits grammar but not intent ("sine the contract") | Homophone substitution | Homophones pass grammar checks, so test against intent, not syntax (`references/repair.md`) |
| Fluent sentence unrelated to the conversation ("Thanks for watching!") | Engine hallucination on silence or noise | Drop it entirely; ignore it completely (`references/degraded.md`) |
| Same phrase repeated 3+ times in a row | Decoder loop, not the user | Keep one instance, drop the rest (`references/degraded.md`) |
| Message ends mid-clause | Truncated audio | Ask for the tail only, bypass re-dictation (`references/degraded.md`) |
| Two languages in one message, or a known non-English speaker arrives in English | Code-switching or auto-detect flip | `references/multilingual.md` |
| "um", "uh", "you know" littering the text | Engine transcribed disfluencies | Strip before interpreting; omit them when quoting back to the user |
| 3+ suspect tokens in one message | Mic or noise problem, not a lexical error | Halt piecewise repair; quote your full interpretation back for a yes/no |
| Same term mangled across 5+ sessions | Engine vocabulary gap | Fix upstream with vocabulary biasing (`references/tuning.md`) |
| Anything else: transcript reads clean | No error | Respond normally; proceed normally without mentioning transcription |

## Core Rules

1. **Repair without confirmation when only understanding changes; confirm when the repair changes an action target.** Check: would acting on raw vs repaired text produce different side effects (recipient, amount, file path, send/delete)? Different side effects = confirm first. Same outcome = fix without asking and move on. Full ladder in `references/actions.md`.
2. **Confirm with a candidate, use candidates instead of open questions.** "Did you mean Kubernetes?" costs the user one word; "What did you say?" forces full re-dictation. Offer 1 candidate; 2 only when both fit equally; maximum 2.
3. **Two-strike promotion.** First observed fix = candidate: apply it but surface it ("...on Kubernetes, got it"). Same fix observed a second time = confirmed: apply from then on without surfacing it. One user rejection at any stage = move the pair to the Never list.
4. **Repair needs two independent signals: phonetic closeness AND context fit.** Phonetic test: fold confusable consonants (B/P, D/T, C/K/Q — full class table in `references/repair.md`), strip vowels, collapse doubles, then compare skeletons. "web look" → WPLK vs "webhook" → WPHK is skeleton edit distance 1 (one substitution, L/H); distance ≤2 = neighbor. Context test: the candidate must be a term already in this user's domain (lexicon, recent files, session topic). Either signal alone is a guess, not a repair.
5. **Correction direction is common-word → proper-noun, rarely the reverse.** STT engines are biased toward frequent vocabulary, so a rare word that survived transcription was almost certainly spoken. Preserve odd-looking codenames into a dictionary word.
6. **Echo digits for any number that gates an action.** "Booked for 15 (one five) at 8pm." The seven -teen/-ty pairs are the highest-frequency STT number confusion (`references/numbers.md`), and a wrong booking count costs more than three extra characters in every reply.
7. **A fluent sentence that ignores the conversation is the engine, not the user.** Whisper-family models emit caption boilerplate ("Thank you.", "Thanks for watching!") on silence or noise-only audio. Drop it; interpreting it as user intent invents a request nobody made. Signatures in `references/degraded.md`.
8. **3+ suspect tokens = halt repairing tokens.** Piecewise repair of a noise-storm transcript compounds guesses into a sentence the user did not say. Quote your full best-effort reading back for a single yes/no instead.

## Repair Procedure

1. Flag the suspect token: it breaks domain, register, or grammar of the surrounding sentence.
2. Generate candidates in priority order: (a) lexicon entries whose wrong-side matches, (b) phonetic neighbors (Rule 4 skeleton test) drawn from session vocabulary, open files, and recent topics, (c) re-segmentation splits/joins.
3. Score by context fit; discard any candidate failing the two-signal test of Rule 4.
4. Route by Rule 1: side effects → confirm with the top candidate; understanding only → substitute without confirmation.
5. After user confirmation or correction, append the pair to the lexicon (`references/lexicon.md`).

Worked candidate generation, sound-class folding, segmentation repair, and the homophone catalog: `references/repair.md`.

## Correction Lexicon

One line per pair in `<state_root>/lexicon.md`:

```
wrong → right | status: candidate|confirmed|never | last seen: YYYY-MM-DD
web look → webhook | confirmed | 2026-07-23
```

- Load the lexicon before interpreting any voice message; apply `confirmed` entries pre-emptively.
- `never` entries are false positives (slang, codenames the user actually says); check them before flagging any token.
- Lifecycle, pruning thresholds, and the config file format: `references/lexicon.md`.

## Output Gates

Before replying to any voice-sourced message, check:

- Did any repaired token feed an action with side effects? If yes, was it confirmed or lexicon-`confirmed`?
- Is every action-gating number echoed as digits somewhere in my reply?
- Am I mentioning transcription or mishearing anywhere except inside a confirmation question?
- Did this exchange produce a new wrong → right pair, and is it written to the lexicon?
- If I produced a dictated artifact: are self-corrections applied, filler handled per `dictation_mode`, and uncertain tokens marked?
- Did I drop (not interpret) any hallucinated or looped text?

## Configuration

User-dependent variables. Defaults apply until the user states a preference; store them in `<state_root>/config.yaml`.

| Variable | Type | Default | Effect |
|---|---|---|---|
| dictation_mode | cleaned \| verbatim | cleaned | `references/dictation.md`: cleaned strips filler and applies spoken self-corrections; verbatim preserves every word including disfluencies |
| number_echo | actions-only \| always \| never | actions-only | When Rule 6 digit-echoing fires: only for numbers gating actions, for every number, or never (user finds echoes noisy) |
| confirmation_posture | standard \| strict | standard | strict: confirm every repair that feeds an action, even lexicon-`confirmed` ones; standard follows Rule 1 |
| languages | list (BCP-47 codes) | [en] | Languages the user speaks; gates code-switch handling in `references/multilingual.md` and language-pinning advice in `references/tuning.md` |
| lexicon_ttl_days | number (30-365) | 90 | Days without a sighting before a lexicon entry is pruned (`references/lexicon.md`) |

Preference areas to record as the user reveals them:

- **vocabulary domain** — the user's field (dev, medical, legal, finance); seeds candidate scoring in `references/repair.md` and biasing terms in `references/tuning.md`
- **artifact formatting** — punctuation habits, paragraphing, sign-offs for dictated emails and documents; affects `references/dictation.md` output
- **engine and tooling** — which STT engine, model, and capture setup the user runs; targets the advice in `references/tuning.md`
- **channel mix** — voice-only vs mixed typing-and-voice sessions; affects which messages get repair at all (typed input bypasses phonetic repair)
- **spelling conventions** — NATO vs plain letters when confirming spellings, diacritics handling for names; affects `references/names.md` confirmations

## Traps

| Trap | Why it fails | Do instead |
|---|---|---|
| "Fixing" slang or project codenames | Codenames are deliberately odd; one wrong rewrite teaches the user the agent edits their words | Require both Rule 4 signals; maintain the Never list |
| Asking "what did you say?" | Forces full re-dictation, often while the user is hands-busy, which is why they used voice | Yes/no question with your best candidate |
| Repairing inside dictated artifacts (emails, docs) without marking it | Dictated content is the user's own voice; unmarked edits change what they said | Produce the artifact with repairs applied but uncertain tokens marked for review (`references/dictation.md`) |
| Keeping corrections only in conversation memory | Lost at session end; the user re-teaches the same name weekly | Persist every pair to `<state_root>/lexicon.md` immediately |
| Applying phonetic repair to typed input | Typing errors follow keyboard adjacency, not sound; phonetic candidates are noise there | Gate this skill on voice-sourced input only |
| Narrating every fix ("your STT said X, I read Y") | Makes the voice channel feel broken and erodes trust in silent repairs | Rule 1 routing: silent when understanding-only, one short confirmation otherwise |
| Promoting a pair to confirmed after one sighting | A single fix may be context-specific; auto-applying it rewrites future valid words | Two-strike promotion (Rule 3); demote on first rejection |
| "Improving" the user's grammar or word choice while repairing | Non-native phrasing and casual register are the speaker, not the engine | Repair only tokens the engine plausibly garbled; leave style alone |
| Interpreting a hallucinated closing line as a request | "Thank you, goodbye" from silence reads like the user ending the task | Rule 7: drop boilerplate that ignores the conversation |

## Where Experts Disagree

- **Silent vs surfaced repair.** Transparency school surfaces every fix; fluency school hides all of them. The working boundary: surface while a pair is `candidate`, go silent once `confirmed`, and always confirm when side effects ride on the repair (Rules 1 and 3). Full transparency is available on request — the lexicon is a readable file.
- **Cleaned vs verbatim dictation.** Smart-dictation products clean filler and apply self-corrections; court-reporter style keeps every word. Default cleaned; verbatim when the user asks for exact words or the artifact is quoted testimony. `dictation_mode` records the user's side.
- **Fix upstream vs repair downstream.** Engine vocabulary biasing kills recurring errors at the source but over-biasing makes the engine hallucinate the boosted terms into unrelated audio. Boundary: 5+ recurring terms justify upstream tuning (`references/tuning.md`); one-off errors stay downstream in the repair layer.
