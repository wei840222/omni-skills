## Status Values

| Value | Meaning | Behavior |
|-------|---------|----------|
| `ongoing` | Context still evolving | Keep capturing study constraints naturally |
| `complete` | Context is sufficient | Execute workflows without setup follow-ups |
| `paused` | User paused setup details | Keep working with existing context |
| `skip_setup` | User rejected setup prompts | Bypass setup follow-ups in the future |

## Principles

- Keep entries concise, factual, and easy to verify.
- Update `last` after each meaningful study workflow.
- Store patterns and decisions, not sensitive personal data.
- Prefer durable observations over temporary one-off notes.
