| `RegExp.escape` | ES2025 | >=24 |

A missing floor is a runtime TypeError in production, not a build error — match this table against your lowest supported runtime before using anything below ES2022.

## Optional Chaining Semantics

- `obj.method?.()` guards `method`; `obj?.method()` guards `obj`. Different nulls, different fixes.
- `a?.b.c`: if `a` is nullish the whole expression short-circuits to undefined; but if `a.b` is nullish, `.c` THROWS. One `?.` protects only its own link.
- `?.` does not guard callability: `x.fn?.()` with `fn = 3` throws (→ SKILL.md Traps).
- `delete a?.b` is legal; `a?.b = 1` is a SyntaxError — you cannot assign through `?.`.

## Defaults & Destructuring

- Defaults fire on undefined ONLY: `f(null)` keeps null; `({a = 1} = {a: null})` → `a` is null. Nullish-safe: apply `?? fallback` after destructuring.
- Nested destructuring of null throws: `{a: {b}} = {a: null}` — and an `= {}` default does not save you, it only covers undefined. Destructure one level, then `a?.b`.

## Classes

- Field initializers run per instance in definition order. `field = () => ...` creates one closure per instance: costs memory, lives off the prototype, so spies/mixins/`super.method()` dispatch bypass it. Prototype methods unless you specifically need bound `this`.
- `this` before `super()` in a subclass constructor → ReferenceError. Class declarations are in the TDZ (no use-before-declare). Class bodies are always strict mode.
- `#private` is enforced by the language (unlike `_convention`). Brand-check membership with `#x in obj` instead of try/catch.

## Iterators & Generators

- A generator is single-use: `[...gen]` twice yields everything, then NOTHING — silently. Re-invoke the generator function, or wrap in an iterable object whose `[Symbol.iterator]()` calls it fresh.
- `for...of` DISCARDS a generator's `return` value (`{done: true, value}`) — only manual `.next()` or `yield*` observes it. Instead of smuggling results through `return`; yield them.
- Generators are lazy: nothing runs until the first `.next()`, and code between yields runs on demand — argument validation before the first `yield` doesn't fire at call time (wrap: validate in a regular function that returns the generator).
- `yield*` delegates to any iterable and evaluates to the delegate's return value — the composition primitive.
- Async generators + `for await...of` are sequential BY DESIGN: one item awaited at a time. They are a streaming tool, not a parallelism tool — fan-out belongs to the pool pattern (→ async.md).
- `for await...of` over an array of already-created promises hides no rejections but processes in array order — a later fast rejection waits, unhandled, for its turn (same window as async.md's pre-created array trap).
- Iterator helpers (floor above) are lazy — no intermediate arrays (→ performance.md) — but consume the underlying iterator: single pass still applies.

## Modules (ESM/CJS)

- ESM exports are live bindings; CJS exports are an object copied at `require` time. Circular ESM → TDZ ReferenceError at first access; circular CJS → silently partial object. Fix both the same way: extract the shared piece into a third module.
- `import * as ns` is frozen — patching for tests needs dependency injection or a mocking loader, not assignment.
- No `__dirname`/`__filename` in ESM: `import.meta.dirname` (floor above) or `fileURLToPath(import.meta.url)`.
- Dual-package hazard: one package resolved once as CJS and once as ESM loads TWICE — singletons split and `instanceof` fails across the boundary. Symptom: "x is not an instance of X" with identical class names.
- `require()` of synchronous ESM works on Node >=22.12; below that, dynamic `import()` is the only bridge from CJS.
- Modules are singletons per resolved URL: a `?v=2` query yields a fresh copy — deliberate cache-bust in dev, memory leak if abused.
- Top-level await blocks every importer until it settles; a rejection fails the whole graph (→ async.md).
- ESM files are always strict mode — `"use strict"` only matters in legacy scripts.
