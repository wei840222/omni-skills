# Security — ACLs, Exposure, Command Policy

An unauthenticated Redis reachable from the internet is not "a misconfiguration to fix later": it is remote code execution waiting for a scanner. Treat exposure as a compromise, not a warning.

## The Exposure Attack

Redis with no password and a public bind lets anyone:

1. `CONFIG SET dir /var/lib/redis/.ssh` + `CONFIG SET dbfilename authorized_keys` + a key stored as a value + `SAVE` → their SSH key on your box.
2. `MODULE LOAD` a shared object they wrote to disk the same way → arbitrary code in the server process.
3. `FLUSHALL`, or a ransom note in key `RANSOM`, or a slow exfiltration via `SCAN`.

Mitigations that exist by default: `protected-mode yes` refuses non-loopback connections when no password and no explicit `bind` are configured. Any deployment that sets `bind 0.0.0.0` for convenience has turned it off.

If an instance was ever exposed: rotate every credential that transited it, inspect `authorized_keys` and crontabs on the host, check `MODULE LIST` and `CONFIG GET dir`, and rebuild the host rather than cleaning it.

## Baseline Hardening

- Bind to a private interface, and put the instance in a security group / firewall that admits only the application subnet. Network first — everything below is defence in depth.
- Require authentication. `requirepass` is the legacy single password; ACL users (Redis >=6) are the real mechanism.
- Disable or rename the dangerous admin surface: `FLUSHALL`, `FLUSHDB`, `CONFIG`, `DEBUG`, `SHUTDOWN`, `KEYS`, `MODULE`. Renaming with `rename-command` is legacy; the modern form is an ACL that never grants those categories.
- TLS in transit for anything crossing a host boundary.
- Run as a non-root user with the data directory owned by it. The attack above depends on Redis being able to write where it should not.
- No credentials in key names or values you would not want in a `MONITOR` transcript, an RDB backup, or a slowlog entry.

## ACLs

```bash
ACL SETUSER app on '>secret' '~app:*' '&app:events:*' +@read +@write +@list +@hash -@dangerous
ACL SETUSER metrics on '>secret2' allkeys +info +client|list +latency +slowlog
ACL WHOAMI
ACL GETUSER app
ACL LIST
ACL SAVE                 # persist to aclfile; without it, changes die at restart
```

- Structure: `on`/`off`, `>password`, key patterns `~pattern`, channel patterns `&pattern` (Pub/Sub is *not* covered by key patterns), command rules `+cmd`/`-cmd`/`+@category`/`-@category`.
- Start from nothing and add: `-@all +@read +@write ~app:*` beats `+@all -@dangerous`, because new commands in future versions default to denied.
- Useful categories: `@admin`, `@dangerous`, `@keyspace`, `@blocking`, `@scripting`, `@pubsub`. `ACL CAT <category>` lists exactly what a category contains on *your* version — read it rather than assuming.
- Per-service users, never one shared account: the ACL is also your audit trail and your blast-radius limit.
- Store users in an `aclfile` under configuration management. `ACL SETUSER` at runtime without `ACL SAVE` is a change that vanishes at the next restart.
- `ACL LOG` records denied attempts — a real signal that a service is doing something nobody designed.

## Scripting And Modules

- Lua runs in a sandbox with no filesystem or network access, but it runs *your* server's thread: a script is a denial-of-service vector even when it cannot escape.
- Deny `@scripting` to services that do not need it. A service that can `EVAL` can do anything its key permissions allow, in arbitrary combinations.
- `MODULE LOAD` is effectively "run this native code": it should be denied to every application user, always.

## Multi-Tenancy

- Numbered databases are not a security boundary: no ACL, no memory, no CPU separation.
- Key-prefix ACLs (`~tenant:42:*`) are a real boundary for keys, but `INFO`, `DBSIZE`, `SCAN` and Pub/Sub channels still leak shape and volume unless also restricted.
- Hard isolation between tenants means separate instances. Say that plainly rather than building prefix rules that a single `KEYS` permission undoes.

## Data At Rest

- RDB and AOF files are plaintext copies of your dataset, and so are the backups you ship elsewhere. Encrypt the volume and the backup destination.
- Redis has no per-value encryption: anything encrypted must be encrypted by the application before `SET`, which also means you cannot index, range or increment it.
- Keys are not encrypted even when values are — do not put personal data in key names.

## Audit Checklist

- Is the instance reachable only from the application subnet, verified from outside rather than assumed?
- Is `protected-mode` on, or is authentication configured because it is off?
- Does every service have its own ACL user with the smallest key pattern and command set that works?
- Are `CONFIG`, `MODULE`, `DEBUG`, `SHUTDOWN`, `FLUSH*` denied to every application user?
- Is `aclfile` (or the provider's equivalent) under version control, and does `ACL LIST` match it?
- Is TLS on for every connection that leaves a host, with certificate expiry monitored?
- Do backups live somewhere with the same access controls as the live data?
- Does `ACL LOG` get read by anyone, or is it just accumulating?

## Security Advisories And Upgrades

Consult the current [Redis Security Advisories](https://github.com/redis/redis/security/advisories) for the exact affected and fixed releases before selecting an upgrade target. Advisory identifiers, affected components, and fixed versions change over time; preserve the advisory URL and selected release in the change record.

Pin the server and module versions in production, rehearse upgrades in staging, and verify the deployed version after rollout. Keep untrusted clients behind the network and ACL boundary described above.
