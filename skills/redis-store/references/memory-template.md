# Redis Memory

## Status
status: ongoing

## Context
<!-- What Redis is used for here: cache, sessions, queue, rate limiting, primary store -->
<!-- Observed facts: version, topology, provider, instance size, whether persistence is on -->

## Incidents
<!-- What has already gone wrong: OOM, latency spike, lost writes, exposed instance -->

## Constraints
<!-- Commands the platform forbids, compliance requirements, tables/keyspaces that must not be touched -->

## Preferences
<!-- Key naming, Lua welcome or not, verbosity, whether admin commands may be run directly -->
