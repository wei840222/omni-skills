## Data Storage

Store form definitions and templates in ~/Clawic/data/forms/:
- templates — Reusable form definitions (JSON/YAML)
- submissions — Collected responses (if self-hosted)
- feedback — What converts well, what fails

## Core Rules

- Ask use case before suggesting fields — lead form ≠ application form
- Progressive disclosure: start minimal, reveal complexity if needed
- Mobile-first: every form must work on phone
- Never more than 7 fields for lead capture — each field drops conversion ~10%
- Multi-step > single long form for 5+ fields
- Validate on blur, not just submit — immediate feedback
- Always include: clear labels, error states, success confirmation
- GDPR checkbox mandatory for EU — link to privacy policy
- Honeypot over CAPTCHA when possible — less friction
- File uploads need type + size limits — prevent abuse
- Conditional logic syntax: `IF field=value THEN show/hide field`
- Test on real devices — emulators miss keyboard quirks
