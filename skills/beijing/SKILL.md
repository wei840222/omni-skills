## State location

Beijing state may exist in `<workspace>/beijing/`, `<workspace>/memory/beijing/`, or `~/beijing/`.
Before reading or writing state, resolve `<state_root>` as follows:

1. Use an explicitly configured path when one exists.
2. Otherwise use the first existing directory in this order:
   `<workspace>/beijing/`, `<workspace>/memory/beijing/`, `~/beijing/`.
3. If none exists and state must be created, default to `<workspace>/beijing/`.

Use the selected `<state_root>` for every state operation in this skill.


## Reference Loading Instructions

Load reference files on demand based on the user's specific context:

| Category | Reference File | When to load |
|---|---|---|
| **First Use** | `references/setup.md` | When initializing the user environment for Beijing tasks. |
| **Visitor** | `references/visitor-attractions.md`, `references/visitor-tips.md`, `references/visitor-itineraries.md`, `references/visitor-lodging.md` | When planning trips, itineraries, or finding places to visit and stay. |
| **Relocation** | `references/neighborhoods-choosing.md`, `references/cost.md`, `references/visas.md` | When the user is moving to Beijing, looking for rent, or needs visa information. |
| **Daily Life** | `references/transport.md`, `references/food-practical.md`, `references/healthcare.md`, `references/lifestyle.md` | For questions about subway, dining, hospitals, and local apps. |
| **Work / Tech** | `references/business.md`, `references/jobs.md`, `references/tech.md`, `references/startup.md` | For queries about work permits, tech salaries, WFOE, or teaching. |
| **Family** | `references/education.md`, `references/family.md` | When picking schools, having a baby, or arranging childcare. |
| **Memory Asset** | `assets/memory-template.md` | To understand the persistent data format for Beijing context. |

## Configuration

User-dependent variables. Defaults apply until the user states a preference; store them in `<state_root>/config.yaml`.

| Variable | Type | Default | Effect |
|---|---|---|---|
| role | visitor \| resident \| tech-worker \| student \| founder | inferred per query | Locks routing (Core Rule 1) to that track; skips the role question |
| home_district | text | none | Anchors commute math, dining picks, and neighborhood comparisons to where the user lives or stays |
| budget_tier | budget \| mid \| premium | mid | Filters lodging, restaurant, and neighborhood recommendations to the matching price band |
| dietary | list | none | Applies `references/food-practical.md` filters (vegetarian, halal, allergies) to every food suggestion |
| mandarin_level | none \| basic \| conversational \| fluent | none | Scales translation workarounds; at conversational+ drop phrase tables and pinyin from answers |
| aqi_alert | number (AQI) | 150 | Threshold that triggers indoor-backup suggestions in any outdoor plan (Core Rule 8) |
| home_currency | ISO code | none (falls back to `~/Clawic/profile.yaml`) | Adds a converted figure next to every ¥ amount |

Preference areas to record as the user reveals them:

- **travel style** — pace (packed vs relaxed), crowd tolerance, guided vs independent; affects itinerary density and Great Wall section choice
- **food** — spice tolerance, street-food adventurousness, cuisine leanings; affects which food file leads
- **transport** — subway-first vs DiDi-first vs bike, walking tolerance; affects every route suggestion
- **compliance posture** — how conservatively to treat gray areas (VPN, remote work on dependent visas); affects `references/safety.md`/`references/visas.md` framing
- **cadence** — trip dates or arrival date; affects which seasonal and holiday warnings get volunteered

## When To Use

- Trip planning: attractions, itineraries, lodging, day trips, scam avoidance
- Relocation: neighborhood choice, rent, schools, healthcare, PSB registration
- Career: tech salaries, jobs and teaching, work permits (Z visa, A/B/C tiers), WFOE setup, startups
- Daily-life setup: WeChat/Alipay, SIM, banking, transport, AQI strategy
- Long-arc residency: expat taxes, having a baby, learning Mandarin, exiting China cleanly
- Not for other Chinese cities: payment/app setup transfers to Shanghai or Shenzhen; neighborhood, rent, and hukou specifics do not — route to the `china` skill.

## Core Rules

### 1. Route by Role AND Timeline
Same question, different file: "where should I stay" → `references/visitor-lodging.md` for a week, `references/neighborhoods-choosing.md` for a move. Ask which before answering (skip the question when `role` is set in config or obvious from context). If the user is already inside China without a VPN, only suggest solutions that work behind the Firewall — app-store links, Google Docs, and gmail-verification flows are dead ends.

### 2. Pre-Arrival Sequence (order matters, each step gates the next)
1. Install and TEST a VPN — cannot be downloaded once inside China.
2. Set up WeChat + Alipay, verify with passport; link Visa/Mastercard (supported since 2023). Alipay "Tour Pass" alternative: load from foreign card, 90-day validity, ¥10,000 cap.
3. Save every address (hotel, meetings) as Chinese characters — drivers cannot read pinyin.
4. Book Forbidden City ~10 days ahead; it sells out.
If they arrive with only step 0 done, triage in this order — payment before maps. Details: `references/visitor-tips.md`, `references/local.md`.

### 3. Payments: Mobile-First, Cash-Last
Set up BOTH WeChat Pay and Alipay — vendor coverage differs and some merchants take only one. Carry ¥500-1,000 cash as backup: legal tender, but small vendors often cannot make change. Foreign cards work only at international hotels and malls. A dead phone = no payment, no DiDi, no ticket: a power bank is financial equipment here.

### 4. Language Baseline
Assume zero English outside international hotels and Sanlitun: taxi drivers, government offices, hospitals (non-VIP), and most restaurants operate Chinese-only. Default toolkit: Amap or DiDi in English mode + camera translation + addresses saved in characters. Survival phrases and Beijing-accent notes: `references/culture.md`.

### 5. Planning Baselines (updated February 2026)
Canonical detail lives in the reference files. These are planning baselines, not live quotes; verify current values against an authoritative source before presenting them as current.

| Item | Range | Canonical file |
|------|-------|----------------|
| 1BR rent, CBD/Guomao | ¥10,000-18,000/mo | `references/neighborhoods-index.md` |
| 1BR rent, Sanlitun | ¥9,000-15,000/mo | `references/neighborhoods-index.md` |
| 1BR rent, Zhongguancun | ¥6,000-10,000/mo | `references/neighborhoods-index.md` |
| Senior SWE (5-8 yrs) | ¥50,000-80,000/mo | `references/tech.md` |
| Subway single ride | ¥3-10 (distance-based) | `references/transport.md` |
| Taxi flagfall | ¥13 | `references/visitor-tips.md` |
| Hotpot dinner for two | ¥150-300 | `references/food-overview.md` |
| International school | ¥200,000-350,000/yr (bilingual from ¥100,000) | `references/education.md` |
| IIT effective rate at ¥720,000/yr gross | ≈18% (worked example) | `references/taxes.md` |

### 6. Registration Is a Hard Deadline
All foreigners register with the local PSB within 24 hours of arrival. Hotels do it automatically; private residences and many Airbnb hosts do NOT — then it is on you. Re-register within 24 hours after every address change and after each visa renewal. Skipping it surfaces later at visa renewal: fines, delays, possible deportation. See `references/visas.md`, `references/safety.md`.

### 7. Transport Default: Subway + DiDi
Subway for anything near a line (¥3-10, English signage, add 3-5 min at each entry for X-ray security); DiDi for the rest. Flagging street taxis rarely works — drivers take jobs via DiDi. Worked example, Great Wall day: DiDi to Mutianyu ≈ ¥300 round trip split among passengers vs ¥200-300/person on a tour — a group of 3+ should DiDi. Driving is a trap: license plates are allocated by lottery with years-long odds (`references/driving.md`).

### 8. Weather and AQI Gate the Plan
- AQI >150 → mask outdoors; >200 → move the day's plan indoors (museums, malls, hotpot), N95 if you must go out. Check daily; canonical thresholds in `references/visitor-tips.md`.
- Bad-air season = winter heating season (mid-Nov to mid-Mar). Best months: Sep-Oct.
- Never plan around Oct 1-7 (Golden Week) or Chinese New Year: peak crowds, closures, surge prices.
- Winter -10°C, summer 35°C+: itineraries need seasonal restructuring, not just packing changes (`references/climate.md`).

### 9. Neighborhood Matching

| Profile | Best areas | Why |
|---------|-----------|-----|
| Young professionals | Sanlitun, CBD, Guomao | Nightlife, expat scene, walkable |
| Expat families | Shunyi, Chaoyang Park area | International schools, space; Shunyi = car required |
| Tech workers | Zhongguancun, Wudaokou, Haidian | Commute to tech campuses |
| Students | Wudaokou | PKU/Tsinghua, cheap, Korean food |
| Budget-conscious | Tongzhou, Changping | Half the rent, 40-60 min commute |
| History/culture | Dongcheng, Xicheng hutongs | Character; check heating/plumbing before signing |
| Default (unsure, mid budget) | Dongzhimen/Sanyuanqiao | Central, Airport Express, moderate rent |

## Hukou & Work Permit Context

- **Hukou (户口)** is household registration for Chinese citizens; Beijing hukou is among the hardest to obtain and gates local schooling and property. Foreigners are outside the hukou system — their equivalent gate is the work permit tier.
- **Work permit tiers**: A (top talent — points score 85+, or qualifying achievement), B (professional — degree + 2 yrs experience typical), C (temporary/intern). Tier determines renewal ease and family visas. Points come from salary, education, experience, HSK level: `references/visas.md`.
- Practical consequence: a B-tier offer letter with salary near the bottom of market range weakens renewals — negotiate salary partly as an immigration asset.

## Verification for Time-Sensitive Guidance

Before answering with a price, schedule, eligibility rule, registration deadline, visa policy, transit network detail, or other volatile fact:

1. Load the relevant `references/` file for the request.
2. Check the official source for the current rule or price: [Beijing Municipal Government](https://english.beijing.gov.cn/), [National Immigration Administration](https://en.nia.gov.cn/), or [Beijing Subway](https://www.bjsubway.com/en/), as appropriate.
3. State the verification date and distinguish the confirmed current rule from planning guidance in this skill.

## Output Gates

Before answering, check:
- Did I identify role (tourist/resident/worker/student/founder) and timeline?
- Are my numbers from the canonical file, quoted with their date?
- Does my advice work behind the Firewall if the user is already in China?
- Did I flag the 24h registration whenever the user mentions arriving or moving?
- Did I apply `config.yaml` values (dietary, budget_tier, aqi_alert, home_currency) instead of the defaults they override?

## Traps

| Trap | Why it fails | Do instead |
|------|--------------|------------|
| Arriving without VPN | Cannot download one inside China; cut off from Google/WhatsApp day 1 | Install + test before boarding |
| Only one payment app | Some vendors take WeChat only, others Alipay only | Set up both, link cards to both |
| Skipping PSB registration | Surfaces at visa renewal as fines/delays | Register within 24h; confirm your landlord/host actually did it |
| Relying on street taxis | Drivers take DiDi jobs; empty cabs pass you by | DiDi app in English mode |
| Buying a car | Plates by lottery, years of waiting; unrestricted driving impossible | Subway + DiDi; plate math in `references/driving.md` |
| Underestimating AQI | 200+ days cluster in winter; no mask = sick, plans ruined | N95s in bag, purifier at home, indoor backup plans |
| Treating cash as primary | Vendors can't make change; queues form behind you | Cash is backup only (¥500-1,000) |
| Booking Badaling | Most crowded Wall section; 2h+ cable queues on holidays | Mutianyu (first visit), Jinshanling (photos), Simatai (night) |
| Golden Week travel | Oct 1-7: attraction quotas sell out, hotel prices surge | Shift trip by one week either side |
| Assuming English menus/staff | Chinese-only outside expat zones | Camera translation, picture menus, saved phrases |
| Working on an M/tourist visa "temporarily" | Deportation + entry ban when caught; schools get raided | Z visa + work permit before day one (`references/jobs.md`, `references/visas.md`) |
| Leaving without the work-permit cancellation certificate | Blocks any future China work permit; unobtainable once the employer moves on | Exit checklist in `references/leaving.md`, 2-3 buffer weeks before the flight |

## Legal Awareness

| Rule | Reality |
|------|---------|
| VPN | Gray zone: personal use tolerated, selling/promoting illegal |
| Working on wrong visa | Z visa + work permit or nothing; violation = deportation + entry ban |
| Drugs | Zero tolerance; any amount is a serious criminal matter |
| Photography | No military, police, or government buildings |
| Political speech | Criticizing Party/government carries real risk — including on WeChat, which is monitored |
| LGBTQ+ | Not illegal, no legal recognition; discretion advised |
