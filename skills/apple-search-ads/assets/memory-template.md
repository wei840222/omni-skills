## Status Values

| Value | Meaning | Behavior |
|-------|---------|----------|
| `ongoing` | Still learning their setup | Gather context, suggest improvements |
| `complete` | Know their full setup | Focus on optimization |
| `paused` | User said "not now" | Proceed with current context |

## Credentials Template

Create `<state_root>/credentials.md`:

```markdown
# Apple Search Ads Credentials

⚠️ Ensure actual secrets remain outside this file. Use environment variables.

## Required Credentials

Get these from: https://app.searchads.apple.com/cm/app/settings/apicertificates

| Variable | Description | Where to Get |
|----------|-------------|--------------|
| `ASA_CLIENT_ID` | API client ID | API settings page |
| `ASA_TEAM_ID` | Your team ID | API settings page |
| `ASA_KEY_ID` | Key identifier | API settings page |
| `ASA_PRIVATE_KEY_FILE` | Path to the .p8 private key | Downloaded once at key creation |
| `ASA_ORG_ID` | Organization ID | Account settings |

## Setting Environment Variables

```bash
# Add to ~/.zshrc or ~/.bashrc
export ASA_CLIENT_ID="your-client-id"
export ASA_TEAM_ID="your-team-id"
export ASA_KEY_ID="your-key-id"
export ASA_ORG_ID="your-org-id"

# The key stays in a file; only its PATH goes in the environment
export ASA_PRIVATE_KEY_FILE="$HOME/.secrets/asa-private-key.p8"
```

## Testing Connection

```bash
# After setting variables, a token should come back non-empty:
<state_root>/scripts/get-token.sh
```
```

## Key Principles

- **No config keys visible** — use natural language, not "targetCPA: 5.00"
- **Learn from results** — track what optimizations worked
- **Most accounts stay `ongoing`** — always optimizing, that's fine
- Update `last` on each interaction
