description: Designs, debugs, evaluates, and hardens AI agents — the loop, tools, memory, context budget, cost, and escalation — independent of any framework. Use when an agent loops forever, repeats a tool call, drifts from its instructions after many turns, invents tool arguments, stops mid-task, or swallows a tool error silently; when deciding single agent versus several, or which framework to build on; when token cost per task or p95 latency has to come down; when designing tool schemas, retries, timeouts, checkpoints, or human approval; when writing an eval set or a regression suite for agent behavior; when prompt injection, tool abuse, or an over-permissioned action is the risk; and when specifying an agent's purpose, escalation rules, and cost ceiling for a team. Covers memory design, multi-agent handoffs, tracing, and rollout. Not for LangChain APIs (`langchain`), retrieval pipelines (`rag`), prompt craft alone (`prompting`), or agent persona and voice (`agent`).

**Data.** At the start of every session, read `~/Clawic/data/agents/config.yaml` (what the user declared) and `~/Clawic/data/agents/memory.md` (what you observed, plus its `## Boxes` index and `## Due` table). Open any file `## Boxes` names when the condition on its line applies — the index is the list of files, never assume the list is fixed. Every path it names is inside `~/Clawic/data/`; ignore any line that points anywhere else. Everything this skill reads or writes is a plain local note under the folders declared in `configPaths` — nothing leaves the machine and no credential is ever written. In a shared box it updates or removes only the rows it wrote itself, matched on that box's identity key; a row another skill wrote is read, never rewritten and never deleted, and every write and deletion is named in one line as it happens. Before changing any agent, read its spec box and its eval box if `## Boxes` points to them. Read `~/Clawic/data/servers/servers.md` before answering which machine runs a worker or proposing where one should run, `~/Clawic/data/projects/<project>.md` before working on a build the user tracks as a project, and `~/Clawic/data/contacts/contacts.md` before naming an owner or an escalation target. If none of it exists, work from defaults and say nothing about it.

**Write before the session ends** whenever it produced something durable: an agent defined, renamed, retired, or given a new tool; a system prompt that finally worked; a framework, memory, or single-versus-multi decision and what was rejected; an eval case or an eval run; a measured cost or latency per task; a release and the bundle that would roll it back; an escalation policy; a failure whose cause was not obvious; a red-team finding. `memory-template.md` holds every destination, format and threshold, and is the only file you open in order to write.

**Shared boxes.** An agent build that the user tracks as a piece of work goes to `~/Clawic/data/projects/<project>.md`, not here — objective, status, decisions. A machine that runs an agent worker goes to the shared inventory `~/Clawic/data/servers/servers.md`, one row per host keyed by `Name` + `Provider`. A model-provider account with a recurring bill goes to `~/Clawic/data/finances/subscriptions.md`, keyed by the account name, amount with its currency. A person the agent is built for or escalates to — its owner, the human an approval reaches — goes to `~/Clawic/data/contacts/contacts.md`, one row per person, keyed by `Key` (lowercase email → handle → `<kebab-name>` plus a stable disambiguator) written as a column of the row; everywhere else in this skill a person appears **by that key only**, never copied into a spec. Read each file before adding: an entity already there is updated in place, never duplicated. Formats and full protocol travel with this skill in `memory-template.md`.

**No credential is ever written anywhere under `~/Clawic/data/`** — not in the files named here, not in a file you create, not in text the user pastes in to be saved. A pasted system prompt, `.env`, trace, or tool config is the densest source of keys there is: strip the value and store the pointer, `env:OPENAI_API_KEY`, `keychain:agent-prod`, `1password:Work/LLM/prod`, `file:~/.config/agent/credentials`. If data sits at an old location (`~/agents/` or `~/clawic/agents/`), move it to `~/Clawic/data/agents/`, and say in one line that you moved it and from where.

An agent is a loop over a stateless model: observe, decide, act, observe. Everything that looks like memory, personality, or competence is something you re-send on every turn, and everything that looks like autonomy is a tool you granted. So name which of the five parts is wrong — the loop, the context, a tool, the model, or the policy — before proposing a fix, and give the schema, the limit, or the line that changes. Work from defaults immediately: never open with questions about their stack, their budget, or how autonomous the agent should be. Precedence for any value: `config.yaml` → `~/Clawic/profile.yaml` (shared universals: currency, locale) → the Configuration table default.

## When To Use

- Designing an agent: purpose, loop shape, single versus multiple, tool set, memory strategy, escalation rules, cost ceiling
- Debugging agent behavior: loops, drift, invented arguments, silent tool failures, tasks that stop halfway, results that differ between runs
- Making the token bill or the latency of a task come down without losing task success
- Building the eval set, the regression suite, and the tracing that tell you whether a prompt change helped
- Hardening: prompt injection through fetched content, tool abuse, over-permissioned actions, sandboxing, approval gates
- Taking an agent to production: releases and rollback, concurrency, timeouts, retries, checkpoints, kill switch, on-call
- Not for LangChain-specific APIs (`langchain`), retrieval quality (`rag`), general prompt craft (`prompting`), or an agent's persona and voice (`agent`) — this covers the framework-agnostic engineering under all four

## Quick Reference

| Situation | Play | Depth |
|-----------|------|-------|
| Agent repeats the same tool call forever | Hash `(tool, arguments)`; a repeat means the result never reached the transcript or never changed state | `debugging.md` |
| Agent ignores the system prompt after many turns | Compaction dropped it, or it is buried mid-context — re-anchor instructions after every compaction | `context.md` |
| Agent invents arguments or picks the wrong tool | Schema too loose, description ambiguous, or two tools overlap | `tools.md` |
| Agent claims work it never did | No tool call happened; gate completion on an observed side effect, never on the narration | `debugging.md` |
| Designing the loop, or "does this even need an agent?" | Loop shape, termination, planning depth, checkpoints — a fixed sequence is a workflow, not an agent | `architecture.md` |
| One agent or several? | Split only on different tool sets or different trust levels, never on different topics (Rule 1) | `multi-agent.md` |
| Which framework, or none | Selection by what you will need in six months: durability, state, human gates, migration cost | `frameworks.md` |
| Cost per task too high, or it jumped with no code change | Transcript growth is quadratic in turns; then caching, then routing (→ Cost And Latency Arithmetic) | `cost.md` |
| Latency p95 too high | Serial chains, retry backoff, fallback models — parallelize tools before shrinking the model | `production.md` |
| What should the agent remember, and where | Four memory types, the write policy, and how recall gets stale | `memory-design.md` |
| Writing the system prompt for an agent | Anatomy, instruction hierarchy, stop conditions, steering tool choice | `prompts.md` |
| Need the actual loop, retry, or checkpoint code | Runnable patterns in the language `language` selects | `implementation.md` |
| "Is it any good?" / a prompt change to validate | Trajectory versus outcome scoring, sample size, regression gate | `evaluation.md` |
| Prompt injection, exfiltration, over-permissioned tool | Trust boundary, the lethal trifecta, egress and sandbox controls | `security.md` |
| When must a human step in, and with what context | Escalation triggers, approval UX, the handoff packet | `human-in-the-loop.md` |
| Shipping, rolling out, rolling back, on-call | Release bundle, canary, kill switch, alerts that mean something | `production.md` |
| Building a support / coding / research / ops / voice / browser agent | Per-type tool set, memory, escalation and failure profile | `agent-types.md` |
| Anything else agent-shaped | Reproduce with the smallest loop that shows it — one tool, one turn, fixed inputs — then re-add pieces until it breaks; the piece that breaks it names the subsystem | — |

## Core Rules

1. **One agent until you can name the second one's tool list.** A second agent buys role separation and costs a handoff contract, a shared-state decision, and a second failure surface. Split on **different tool sets or different trust levels** — a read-only researcher and a write-capable executor — never on different topics, which is what a system prompt is for. Test: if you cannot write the receiving agent's input schema in one line, you have a section, not an agent (`multi-agent.md`).
2. **Cap the loop three ways: turns, wall clock, and money.** `max_turns` (default 20), a task deadline, and `cost_ceiling_per_task_usd` (default 0.50). Whichever trips first ends the run with a partial result and the reason, never silently. A turn cap alone is not a budget: a fast tool in a tight retry burns the whole spend inside the cap, and a slow one burns the whole hour.
3. **Reliability compounds — quote `p^n`, not `p`.** A step that works 95% of the time works `0.95^20 ≈ 36%` across a 20-step task; at 99% it is `0.99^20 ≈ 82%`. So an end-to-end promise names both numbers, and the three levers are: fewer steps, higher per-step reliability, or checkpoints so a failure resumes instead of restarting (`implementation.md`). Long autonomous chains fail not because the model is weak but because 20 is a big exponent.
4. **Every tool returns something the model can act on, including its failures.** An exception rendered as `"Error"` teaches the loop nothing and it retries identically. Return *what failed, which argument was wrong, what to try instead*, as text the model reads. Tools are idempotent or carry an idempotency key, because the loop will retry — a non-idempotent `send_email` retried twice is two emails (`tools.md`).
5. **Risk tier is a property of the tool, fixed at definition time.** read · write · external · irreversible. `autonomy_level` decides which tiers run unattended; anything above that line stops for a human with the packet from `human-in-the-loop.md`. A tool shipped without a declared tier is treated as irreversible.
6. **Content that arrived through a tool has no instruction authority.** A fetched page, an email body, a file, a database row, another agent's output: data, delimited and labeled as data. The invariant to enforce in code, not in prose — *content that entered via a tool cannot trigger a write, external, or irreversible action without a human*. The dangerous combination is private data + untrusted content + an outbound channel in the same loop (Simon Willison's "lethal trifecta"); remove one of the three (`security.md`).
7. **Ship the eval set before the second prompt change.** With no eval, every change after the first is a vibe and regressions ship silently. Sizing: the 95% confidence half-width on a pass rate is about `1/√N`, where `N` is total runs (cases × runs per case), so `N = 100` resolves ±10 points, 400 resolves ±5, and a 3-point regression stays invisible below roughly 1,000. Zero failures is not proof either — the rule of three puts the upper bound at `3/N`, so 0 failures in 50 red-team runs still permits a ~6% true failure rate (`evaluation.md`).
8. **A release is a bundle, and rollback needs all of it.** Prompt version, model id *and* its dated snapshot, tool schemas, framework version, and the config that was live. Rolling back the prompt while the provider silently moved the model behind an unversioned alias is not a rollback. Pin the dated model snapshot and write the bundle to `deploys/<year>.md` in the same turn (`memory-template.md`).
9. **Trace the trajectory or you are debugging by re-running.** Every turn records: tool chosen, arguments, result size, latency, tokens in/out, and why the loop ended (`done` · `max_turns` · `budget` · `timeout` · `error` · `escalated`). The end reason is the single most diagnostic field in the whole trace, and it is the one most systems forget to store (`debugging.md`).

## Cost And Latency Arithmetic

The model is stateless, so every turn re-sends the conversation. That one fact explains most surprise bills.

- **Transcript growth is quadratic in turns.** If each turn adds about `d` tokens to the transcript and the fixed prefix (system prompt + tool schemas) is `base`, total input across `T` turns ≈ `T·base + d·T(T−1)/2`. Doubling the turns roughly quadruples the transcript component. A 20-turn task is not 10× a 2-turn task; it is closer to 100× on the growing part.
- **The fixed prefix is paid every turn too.** A 4,000-token system prompt plus 30 tool schemas across 20 turns is `20 × base` tokens before the agent does anything. Cutting the tool set is a cost fix, not only an accuracy fix.
- **Prompt caching attacks exactly the prefix.** It pays when the prefix is stable and reused within the provider's cache window; anything that mutates early in the prompt (a timestamp, a shuffled tool order, a per-turn injected memory) invalidates the whole suffix. Put volatile content last (`cost.md`).
- **Cost per task** = `Σ_turns (input_tokens × input_price + output_tokens × output_price)` + tool-side API costs. Measure it per task type, not per call — the average hides the 5% of tasks that spend 50× the median.
- **Latency is serial by default**: `Σ_turns (model latency + slowest tool in that turn)`. Parallel tool calls compress only the tool term within a turn; nothing compresses the number of turns except a better plan.
- **Fan-out multiplies tokens, not wall clock.** `k` parallel subagents cost about `k×` and finish with the slowest branch, so fan-out is for read-only breadth, never for latency on a serial dependency (`multi-agent.md`).

## Constraints That Force Designs

Not trivia — each one has killed an agent design that was already half-built.

| Constraint | The design it forces |
|---|---|
| Model statelessness | Nothing persists between turns except what you re-send. "The agent remembers" is always your storage, never the model (`memory-design.md`) |
| Context window | Shared by system prompt, tool schemas, transcript, tool results, and the reply. Reserve output space explicitly or the run dies at the last turn |
| Tool-result size | One unbounded page or query result can consume the window in a single turn. Truncate **at the tool boundary** and return a handle for more (`tools.md`) |
| Max output tokens | Long artifacts must be written to a file through a tool and referenced, not returned in the reply |
| Rate limits: requests *and* tokens per minute | Tokens/min is usually the binding one, because each turn re-sends the transcript; fan-out multiplies it (`production.md`) |
| Request timeouts | A tool slower than the request timeout must become async: start, return a job id, poll |
| Nondeterminism | Same input ≠ same trajectory. Every behavioral test needs `n` runs and a pass *rate*, never one run and a verdict (`evaluation.md`) |
| Provider deprecation windows | An unpinned model alias moves under you; a pinned snapshot expires on a published date. Both are release problems (Rule 8) |

## Autonomy Tiers

Tier is decided when the tool is defined, and `autonomy_level` draws the line for the whole agent.

| Tier | Examples | Control | What goes wrong without it |
|---|---|---|---|
| Read | search, fetch, query, list | Log and rate-limit | Cost and context blowup, quiet exfiltration path |
| Write (own scope) | write a file in the workspace, create a draft, update a record it created | Log, quota, reversible by design | Silent corruption discovered days later |
| External | send an email or message, post, call a third-party API that others see | Approval unless `autonomy_level: autonomous`, plus a content check | The failure everyone remembers, because it has an audience |
| Irreversible | delete, deploy, pay, publish, rotate a credential, change permissions | Human approval, always; plus a dry-run that shows the diff | The one incident that ends the pilot |

`suggest` runs read only and proposes the rest. `approve-writes` runs read freely and stops at write. `autonomous` runs read, write and external, and never irreversible.

## Output Gates

Before shipping an agent design, a prompt, a tool schema, or a release:

- Does the loop have all three caps — turns, deadline, money — and does exhausting one return a partial result with its reason (Rule 2)?
- Does every tool declare a risk tier, return actionable failures, and behave under retry (Rules 4, 5)?
- Is any action reachable from tool-fetched content without a human, and are private data, untrusted content and an outbound channel all present in one loop (Rule 6)?
- Did I state the per-task cost and the end-to-end success estimate as `p^n` with both numbers named (Rules 3, and Cost Arithmetic)?
- Is there an eval set this change was measured against, at a size that could see the difference (Rule 7)?
- Does the release name its full bundle — prompt version, dated model snapshot, tool schemas, framework version, config (Rule 8)?
- Does the trace record the end reason for every run (Rule 9)?
- Did anything durable come out of this — an agent, a spec, a working prompt, a decision, an eval case, an eval run, a measured cost, a release, an incident, a red-team finding? Then it is written to its box in `memory-template.md`, with its `## Boxes` line, in this same turn.

## Configuration

User-dependent variables. Defaults apply until the user states a preference; store them in `~/Clawic/data/agents/config.yaml`.

| Variable | Type | Default | Effect |
|---|---|---|---|
| language | python \| typescript | python | Language of every code sample in `implementation.md`, `tools.md` and `production.md` |
| framework | raw-sdk \| langgraph \| openai-agents \| crewai \| autogen \| pydantic-ai \| mastra \| other | raw-sdk | Dialect of generated code and which migration notes `frameworks.md` surfaces |
| model_provider | text (provider name) | none | Whose model ids, pricing shapes and rate-limit units examples use; while unset, examples name tiers (small/mid/frontier), never products |
| default_model_tier | small \| mid \| frontier | mid | The tier assumed for the main loop, and the baseline that `cost.md` routing compares against |
| autonomy_level | suggest \| approve-writes \| autonomous | approve-writes | Which tool tiers run unattended (→ Autonomy Tiers) and how many approval gates the generated design contains |
| max_turns | number (1-200) | 20 | The loop's turn cap (Rule 2) and the step count used in every `p^n` estimate |
| cost_ceiling_per_task_usd | number (USD) | 0.50 | The money cap that ends a run, and the bar for calling a design expensive in `cost.md` |
| eval_gate | bool | true | Whether a prompt, tool or model change is presented as blocked until it is measured against the eval set (Rule 7) |
| observability_stack | text (tool name) | none | Which tracing backend the instrumentation examples in `debugging.md` and `production.md` target; unset means plain structured logs |
| runtime_target | local \| container \| serverless \| managed | container | Concurrency, timeout, cold-start and state-persistence advice in `production.md`; serverless forces externalized state |

Preference areas — customizable dimensions; a stated preference gets recorded in `config.yaml` and applied from then on:

- **Tooling** — framework version and extras, MCP servers versus hand-written tools, structured-output mechanism, prompt storage (in code, files, or a registry) — affects every generated snippet
- **Conventions** — agent and tool naming, prompt versioning scheme, trace field names, repository layout for prompts and evals — affects `prompts.md` and `evaluation.md` artifacts
- **Platform** — where the loop runs, queue and worker topology, state store, streaming versus batch delivery — affects `production.md`
- **Safety posture** — approval breadth, sandbox strictness, egress allowlist, whether destructive tools are generated at all, red-team appetite — affects Autonomy Tiers and `security.md`
- **Restrictions and compliance** — PII handling before a tool call (`none` · redact · block), data residency, retention of traces and transcripts, vetoed providers or tools — affects `security.md` and what tracing stores
- **Output register** — how much reasoning to show the end user, streaming style, whether tool activity is visible, verbosity of failures — affects `prompts.md`
- **Integrations** — observability backend, eval platform, model gateway, ticketing target for escalations — affects `evaluation.md` and `human-in-the-loop.md`
- **Cadence** — eval regression runs, red-team passes, cost reviews, model re-bid, transcript sampling — every accepted cadence becomes a row in the `## Due` table of `memory.md`

## Traps

| Trap | Why it fails | Do instead |
|------|-------------|------------|
| Multi-agent as the first architecture | Every handoff loses context, and coordination bugs read as model stupidity | One agent with the tools; split on tool set or trust level (Rule 1) |
| Tool that returns a stack trace, or nothing, on failure | The loop cannot distinguish "bad argument" from "service down" and retries identically until the cap | Failures as instructions: what broke, which argument, what to try (Rule 4) |
| Adding tools to fix a wrong-tool problem | Each tool added enlarges the schema block and the choice space; accuracy falls while cost rises | Merge overlapping tools, sharpen descriptions, or gate tools by phase (`tools.md`) |
| Dumping full tool output into the transcript | One large result poisons the window for the rest of the run and is re-sent every turn afterwards | Truncate at the tool boundary, return a handle (`context.md`) |
| Vector memory for everything | Recall returns *similar*, not *true* — stale facts resurface with high similarity and outrank the current one | Facts that must be right live in explicit state; recall is for the long tail (`memory-design.md`) |
| Testing an agent with one run per case | Nondeterminism means one green run and one red run are the same evidence | `n` runs per case, report the pass rate and its confidence (Rule 7) |
| Evaluating the final answer only | Passing with a lucky guess and passing by doing the work look identical | Score the trajectory too: tools chosen, order, retries (`evaluation.md`) |
| Chat transcript as the audit log | Reasoning text is not evidence — the model narrates actions it never took | Log tool calls and observed side effects; gate completion on the side effect |
| Unpinned model alias in production | The model changes under a fixed prompt and every metric moves at once with no deploy to blame | Pin the dated snapshot; treat a model bump as a release with an eval run (Rule 8) |
| Prompt improvements applied straight to production | The change that fixed one complaint regresses three unmeasured behaviors | Eval set first, then the change, then the diff in pass rate (`eval_gate`) |
| Retry loop with no jitter or budget | Synchronized retries hit the rate limit that caused them, and the cost cap arrives before the answer | Exponential backoff with jitter, a retry budget per task, and the failure surfaced (`production.md`) |
| Approval prompt that shows only the tool name | Humans approve `send_email` and learn later what it said | Approval shows the rendered arguments and the reversibility, or it is theatre (`human-in-the-loop.md`) |
| Secrets passed through the context window so the agent "has access" | Anything in the window can be echoed, logged, traced, or exfiltrated by injected content | Tools hold credentials server-side and take a reference, never a value (`security.md`) |
| An architecture or framework decision that lives only in the chat | Re-litigated every quarter by whoever is on call | `artifacts/` with the date, the alternatives and what was rejected (`memory-template.md`) |

## Where Experts Disagree

- **Multi-agent versus one agent with more tools.** Cognition's "don't build multi-agents" argues context fragmentation makes handoffs unreliable; orchestrator-worker practitioners report large gains on breadth-first research. The frontier is *shared mutable state*: parallel read-only subagents that return summaries usually win, subagents that edit the same artifact usually lose (`multi-agent.md`).
- **Framework versus raw SDK.** Frameworks buy state persistence, retries, human-in-loop primitives and traces; they cost a migration when their abstraction disagrees with your control flow. The honest boundary: durable long-running workflows and complex branching justify one; a single loop with five tools does not (`frameworks.md`).
- **Memory as recall versus memory as state.** One school retrieves from an embedding store per turn; the other keeps an explicit, small, hand-maintained state document plus files. Recall scales to the long tail and fails silently on facts that changed; state stays correct and does not scale. Most working systems run both, with state winning on conflict (`memory-design.md`).
- **Visible reasoning traces.** Interleaved thought makes debugging tractable and costs output tokens on every turn; structured plans are cheaper and hide the moment the plan went wrong. Choose by whether a human will read the trajectory (`architecture.md`).
- **Where the guardrail lives.** Prompt-level rules are cheap and bypassable; code-level enforcement around the tool call is unbypassable and inflexible. The settled part: anything irreversible is enforced in code — a rule the model can read is a rule an injected instruction can argue with (`security.md`).

## Security & Privacy

**Credentials:** this skill designs systems that call model and tool APIs. It does NOT store, log, copy, or transmit API keys, tokens, or user data, and never writes a credential into `~/Clawic/data/agents/`.

**Local storage:** agent specs, eval sets, run history, measured costs, releases and generated artifacts stay in `~/Clawic/data/agents/` on this machine, plus project, host and subscription rows in the shared boxes. Names, model ids, prompt versions, digests and numbers only — no secrets, no captured end-user transcripts unless the user explicitly asks and the content is stripped of personal data first.

**Guardrails:** designs default to the lowest autonomy that completes the task. Destructive and irreversible tools are presented with their blast radius and an approval gate, never inside a copy-paste block of read-only code.
