Training logs, preferences, and derived baselines (e1RMs, resting HR, attendance rate) persist in `~/Clawic/data/fitness/` as plain markdown (see `setup.md` on first use, `memory-template.md` for file formats). If you have data at an old location (`~/fitness/` or `~/clawic/fitness/`), move it to `~/Clawic/data/fitness/`, and say in one line that you moved it and from where. Advise mode: this skill coaches a human who performs the training; escalation thresholds live in the Red Flags table.

## Configuration

User-dependent variables. Defaults apply until the user states a preference; store them in `~/Clawic/data/fitness/config.yaml`.

| Variable | Type | Default | Effect |
|---|---|---|---|
| units | metric \| imperial | metric | All loads, distances, and body-mass numbers render in this system; formulas unchanged |
| training_days | number (2-6) | 3 | Selects the split (`program-design.md`) and divides weekly set targets into sessions |
| session_minutes | number (20-120) | 60 | Caps sets per session; under 40 switches to the time-crunched templates in `minimal-equipment.md` |
| equipment | full-gym \| home-rack \| dumbbells \| bodyweight | full-gym | Filters exercise selection and drives the substitution table in `program-design.md` |
| primary_goal | strength \| muscle \| endurance \| fat-loss \| general | general | Picks the Quick Reference row used as the program base |
| age | number (years) | none | Feeds the Tanaka HRmax estimate (Rule 5) when `measured_hrmax` is unset; falls back to `~/Clawic/profile.yaml` |
| measured_hrmax | number (bpm) | none | Replaces the Tanaka estimate in every heart-rate zone calculation (Rule 5) |

Preference areas to record as the user reveals them:

- **schedule** — preferred training days and times, cadence constraints — places sessions in the weekly template
- **exclusions** — movements ruled out by pain, injury history, or dislike — drives substitutions instead of repeated suggestions
- **risk posture** — conservative vs aggressive load jumps and comeback ramps — scales Rule 1 increments and the Rule 6 rebuild
- **data sources** — which wearable or app supplies HR, sleep, and steps — sets how `tracking.md` interprets their numbers
- **coaching register** — terse prescriptions vs explained reasoning — controls how much rationale accompanies each plan

## When To Use

- Designing or adjusting a training program: strength, muscle, endurance, or general conditioning
- Diagnosing a stalled lift, pace, or body-composition plateau
- Deciding what to prescribe after missed sessions, illness, injury, or a multi-week layoff
- Turning workout logs or wearable trends into a concrete next-session prescription
- Adapting training to home equipment, travel, or a compressed schedule
- Not for meal-level nutrition planning (dietitian/calories) or rep-by-rep set logging (gym)

## Quick Reference

| Situation | Play |
|---|---|
| Goal: strength | 3-6 reps at 80-90% e1RM, 3-5 min rest, 2-4 compound lifts per session, each lift 2-3x/week |
| Goal: muscle | 6-12 reps at RIR 1-3, 10-20 hard sets per muscle per week, each muscle trained 2x/week |
| Goal: endurance | 80/20 split (Seiler): 80% of weekly minutes conversational, 20% hard |
| Goal: fat loss | Keep lifting heavy to preserve muscle in a deficit; deficit math routes to `calories` |
| No training history on file | Baseline and starting-load protocol in `assessment.md` before prescribing loads |
| Returning after 2+ weeks off | Apply the layoff discount (Rule 6); full gap-length table in `comeback.md` |
| Lift stalled 3 sessions | Run the diagnostic order in Progression and Plateaus; playbooks in `progression.md` |
| Scale flat 2+ weeks | Weekly-average check in `body-composition.md` before touching calories or cardio |
| Pain reported | Check Red Flags first, then the DOMS-vs-injury test in Recovery and Readiness |
| No gym, hotel room, 25 minutes | Substitutions and time-crunched templates in `minimal-equipment.md` |
| Wearable flags "low readiness" | Validate against resting HR + sleep + log (`tracking.md`) before changing the plan |
| Anything else / no stated goal | ACSM baseline: 150 min/week moderate cardio plus 2 resistance days covering all major muscles |

Depth on demand: `assessment.md` baselines, testing, starting loads · `program-design.md` splits, templates, substitutions · `progression.md` progression models and plateau playbooks · `cardio.md` zones, intervals, concurrent training · `recovery.md` readiness, deloads, overtraining · `comeback.md` layoffs, illness, injury return · `body-composition.md` fat-loss and muscle-gain phases · `minimal-equipment.md` home, travel, time-crunched · `tracking.md` logs and wearables.

## Core Rules

1. **Progress by double progression, not by feel.** Assign a rep range (e.g. 3x8-12). When every set reaches the top of the range at the same load, add 2.5% for upper-body lifts or 5% for lower-body lifts and drop back to the bottom of the range. Worked example: 3x12 at 60 kg squat completed, next session is 3x8 at 63 kg. This makes overload automatic and stall detection unambiguous.
2. **Estimate max with Epley; never test it casually.** e1RM = load x (1 + reps/30). Example: 100 kg x 5 reps gives 100 x 1.167 = ~117 kg. Estimate e1RM only from sets of 3-8 reps — the formula drifts above ~10 reps and predicts nothing from a high-rep set. Program percentages from e1RM; true 1RM attempts belong only in a planned peak week.
3. **Prescribe effort in reps in reserve (RIR).** Most sets at RIR 1-3; RIR 0 only on the last set of the final week before a deload. Chronic failure training roughly doubles fatigue for a similar stimulus.
4. **Volume has a floor and a ceiling.** Start near 10 hard sets per muscle per week; add 2 sets/week only while logged performance and sleep hold; past ~20 sets/week returns flatten or reverse (Schoenfeld dose-response work). A hard set ends within 3 reps of failure.
5. **Cardio: the 80% easy share is the load-bearing number.** Easy means full sentences are speakable. For HR targets use Karvonen: target = HRrest + intensity% x (HRmax - HRrest), with HRmax = 208 - 0.7 x age (Tanaka; the 220 - age formula drifts 10+ bpm off past age 40). Read age from `age` (config, or `~/Clawic/profile.yaml`); a measured max (`measured_hrmax`) overrides the estimate and needs no age.
6. **Layoff discount by gap length.** A single missed session (gap under one week) costs nothing: skip it, resume as planned, never stack two workouts into one. One full week missed but fewer than two weeks off: resume at the last logged load with no jump, treating the return as a re-entry rather than a discount. Two or more weeks off: apply the discount, subtracting 10% of load per week missed, floor at 50%. Three weeks off a 100 kg lift means resuming near 70 kg, adding back ~10% per week.
7. **Deload on evidence, calendar as backstop.** Trigger: two consecutive sessions below logged numbers on the same lift, or resting HR 5+ bpm above baseline for 3+ mornings. Deload = 1 week at 50% of normal set count, same loads. Even without triggers, cap hard blocks at 4-8 weeks.
8. **Every prescription = exercise + sets x reps + load or RIR + rest.** "3 sets of bench" is not programmable; "3x8 at 70 kg, RIR 2, rest 3 min" can be checked against the log next session.

## Program Design Defaults

- Frequency beats session length: three 45-min full-body sessions outperform one 2-hour session at equal weekly sets, because late-session sets degrade.
- Session order: skill/power work, then the heaviest compound, then secondary compounds, isolation, conditioning last. Hard cardio before squats taxes the lift that pays most.
- Split by available days: 2-3 days = full-body; 4 days = upper/lower; 5-6 days = push/pull/legs. Program to logged attendance plus at most one day, not to stated ambition.
- Weekly movement floor: one squat pattern, one hinge, one horizontal push, one horizontal pull, one vertical push, one vertical pull; isolation fills what is left.
- Rest: 3-5 min on compound strength sets, 1.5-2 min on isolation. Cutting rest to save time cuts next-set load; superset antagonist pairs instead.
- Protein 1.6-2.2 g/kg/day supports adaptation (Morton meta-analysis); anything deeper routes to `calories` or the dietitian skill.

## Progression and Plateaus

Stall = no rep or load improvement on the same lift across 3 consecutive sessions. Diagnostic order, cheapest first:

1. Audit the log, not the program: were those sessions actually at prescribed RIR and rest? Under-resting mimics a plateau.
2. Check inputs: average sleep under 7h or an active calorie deficit explains most stalls; fix inputs before touching the program.
3. Inputs clean: run a deload (Rule 7), resume at 90% of the stall load, and re-run double progression. Approaching the stall from below breaks it more often than pushing at it.
4. Same load stalls again: change one constraint, smallest first: microloading (1.25 kg plates), then rep-range shift (8-12 to 4-6), then exercise variant. One change at a time or the signal of what worked is lost.

Beginners (first ~6 months) skip double progression: add 2.5 kg (upper) or 5 kg (lower) every session until the first stall. Session-to-session progress is the cheapest gains window; spending it on percentage programs wastes months.

Per-symptom plateau playbooks and periodization beyond double progression: `progression.md`.

## Recovery and Readiness

- DOMS vs injury: DOMS is dull, symmetric, in the muscle belly, peaks 24-72h after novel work, and eases during warm-up. Sharp, one-sided, at a joint or tendon, present at rest, or worsening through warm-up = treat as injury and stop loading that pattern (see Red Flags).
- Train through plain DOMS at reduced intensity; soreness does not predict damage, and skipping every sore day halves effective frequency.
- Pre-session readiness check: resting HR within 5 bpm of baseline, sleep 6h or more, appetite normal. Two of three failed: convert the session to Zone 2 cardio or technique work instead of cancelling.
- Detraining rates: strength holds ~3 weeks untrained; VO2max drops measurably within 2-4 weeks. During travel, one heavy full-body session per week maintains strength; cardio needs two short sessions.
- Rebuilding beats building (muscle memory effect): regained strength returns far faster than it was first earned, so the Rule 6 discount costs days, while skipping it risks injury weeks.

Deload execution, the overtraining ladder, and stress-adjusted training: `recovery.md`.

## Red Flags

| Signal (observable) | Suspicion | Action |
|---|---|---|
| Chest pain or pressure during exertion, radiating to arm or jaw | Cardiac event | Stop immediately, emergency services |
| Fainting or near-fainting during or right after exercise | Arrhythmia or cardiac cause | Stop training, clinician this week, no intensity until cleared |
| Cola-colored urine plus severe swelling after an extreme session | Rhabdomyolysis | Emergency care the same day |
| Sharp joint pain with swelling, or pain that alters gait | Structural injury | Stop loading that pattern; clinician if not improving in 5-7 days |
| Numbness, tingling, or weakness down a limb | Nerve involvement | Stop the provoking exercise, clinician |
| Resting HR 5+ bpm elevated for a full week plus performance and sleep decline despite a deload | Overtraining syndrome or illness | Suspend hard training; clinician if unresolved in 2 weeks |
| Wheeze or chest tightness triggered by exercise | Exercise-induced bronchoconstriction | Clinician before further intensity work |
| Pregnancy, or a diagnosed cardiac, metabolic, or renal condition, and no clinician clearance on file | Population needing medical sign-off | Advise clearance before new vigorous programming; keep current cleared activity |

Anything in this table suspends every protocol above: route to a clinician.

## Output Gates

Before emitting any training prescription, verify:

- Does every exercise line carry sets x reps + load or RIR + rest (Rule 8)?
- Is weekly volume per muscle inside the 10-20 hard-set corridor (Rule 4)?
- Was the next load computed from the logged last session, not from memory or the template?
- If pain, dizziness, or unusual fatigue was mentioned anywhere, was the Red Flags table checked first?
- After a gap of 2+ weeks, was the layoff discount applied (Rule 6)?
- Does the plan fit `training_days`, `session_minutes`, and `equipment` from config, not an idealized gym?

## Traps

| Trap | Why it fails | Do instead |
|---|---|---|
| Programming to stated ambition | Adherence predicts results more than program choice; 6-day plans collapse to 0 | Logged attendance + max 1 day |
| Adding volume to break a stall | Stalls are usually recovery-limited; more sets deepen the hole | Diagnostic order in Progression and Plateaus |
| Every cardio session moderately hard | The gray zone: too hard to recover from, too easy to drive adaptation | 80/20 split (Rule 5) |
| Changing the program every 4 weeks | Double progression needs 6+ weeks to expose a real stall; novelty resets the signal | One variable, only at a diagnosed stall |
| Testing 1RM to measure progress | A max attempt costs a week of recovery and spikes injury exposure | Epley e1RM from rep sets (Rule 2) |
| Guilt-framing missed sessions | Shame predicts dropout; the log is data, not a verdict | Apply Rule 6 and move on |
| Treating wearable readiness scores as ground truth | Proprietary scores blend unvalidated inputs | Raw resting HR + sleep hours + log vs performance |
| Chasing soreness as proof of a good session | DOMS tracks novelty, not growth; a stable program stops hurting while still working | Judge by log trend (`tracking.md`), not by ache |
| Copying an advanced athlete's program | Their volume tolerance took years; their program is the result of adaptation, not the cause | Start at the Rule 4 floor and earn additions |

## Where Experts Disagree

- **Training to failure vs stopping short.** Failure maximizes per-set stimulus but roughly doubles fatigue (Rule 3). Default: RIR 1-3 on compounds; failure defensible only on the last set of single-joint work, where a missed rep costs nothing.
- **How much periodization non-athletes need.** Comparative reviews (Afonso) find little advantage for complex periodization over progressive overload plus deloads in non-competitors. Default: double progression with Rule 7 deloads; block periodization only when peaking for a dated event (`progression.md`).
- **Cardio while building muscle.** The interference camp minimizes it; the health camp keeps it. Boundary: interference is real mainly at high endurance volumes in the same muscles (Hickson). Default: keep the ACSM 150-min floor, low-impact, placed by the ordering rules in `cardio.md`.
