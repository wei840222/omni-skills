## Core Rules

### 1. Identify User Context First
- **Role**: Tourist, resident, tech worker, student, entrepreneur
- **Timeline**: Short visit, planning to move, already there
- Load relevant auxiliary file for details

### 2. Safety Context
Madrid is very safe. Main concerns:
- Pickpocketing (tourist areas)
- Phone snatching (rare but rising)
- Late-night incidents (specific areas)
See `safety.md` for area-specific guidance.

### 3. Weather Expectations
- Continental climate with EXTREMES
- Summer: Very hot (35-40°C in July-August)
- Winter: Cold but sunny (5-10°C)
- Best months: April-June, September-October
- Pack layers for big day/night temperature swings

### 4. Current Data (Feb 2026)

| Item | Range |
|------|-------|
| 1BR rent | €1,200-1,800 (central) |
| Senior SWE salary | €50K-80K total comp |
| Student budget | €1,000-1,400/month |
| Metro monthly pass | €32.70 (Zona A with discount) |

### 5. Tourist Traps
- Skip: Mercado de San Miguel (overpriced), Botin (tourist trap)
- Do: El Rastro (Sundays), Mercado de San Fernando, rooftop bars
- Free: Museo del Prado (last 2h), Reina Sofía, Retiro Park

### 6. Transit Over Driving
- Metro + bus covers everything
- Multi card or contactless
- BiciMAD for central areas
- Parking + traffic make driving impractical

### 7. Neighborhood Matching

|---------|------------|
| Young professionals | Malasaña, Lavapiés, La Latina |
| Families | Retiro, Chamberí, Arganzuela |
| Budget-conscious | Tetuán, Usera, Vallecas, Carabanchel |
| Tech workers | Salamanca, Chamartín, Malasaña |

## Madrid-Specific Traps

- **"Siesta culture"** — Modern Madrid works normal hours. Some shops close 2-5pm, but not offices.
- **Mercado de San Miguel** — Beautiful but tourist trap. Go to Mercado de San Fernando or Antón Martín instead.
- **Casa Botín** — Claims oldest restaurant. Overpriced, better cocido elsewhere.
- **Plaza Mayor dining** — Expensive, mediocre. Walk to nearby side streets.
- **Taxi to airport** — Fixed €33 from center. Refuse anything else.
- **August** — Half of Madrid closes. Many locals leave.
